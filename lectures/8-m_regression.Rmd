## Today

- Introduction to multiple regression

---

## Regression equation

$$\large \hat{Y} = b_0 + b_1X_1 + b_2X_2 + \dots+b_kX_k$$

- regression coefficients are "partial" regression coefficients  

  - predicted change in $Y$ for a 1 unit change in $X$, *holding all other predictors constant* 
  
  - similar to semi-partial correlation -- represents part of each $X$

---
## Interpretting multiple regression model
$$\large \hat{Y} = b_0 + b_1X_1 + b_2X_2 + \dots+b_kX_k$$

- Intercept is the value of $Y$ when all predictors = 0
- Regression coefficients are the predicted change in $Y$ for a 1 unit change in $X$, *holding all other predictors constant*

---
### Interpretting multiple regression model
$$\large \hat{Y} = b_0 + b_1X_1 + b_2X_2 + \dots+b_kX_k$$

- Residual in simple regression can be thought of as a measure of $Y$ that is left over after accounting for your DV
- Partial correlation can be created by:

  1. create a measure of $X_1$ that is independent of $X_2$
  2. create a measure of $Y$ that is independent of $X_2$
  3. correlate the new measures
---

## Example
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(here)
stress.data = read.csv(here("data/stress.csv"))
library(psych)
describe(stress.data$Stress)
```

---

## Example

```{r, output.lines = c(9:19)}
mr.model <- lm(Stress ~ Support + Anxiety, data = stress.data)
summary(mr.model)
```

???

If a univariate regression is estimating the best-fit line, what is this estimating?

---
## Visualizing multiple regression

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(visreg)

visreg2d(mr.model,"Support", "Anxiety", plot.type = "persp")

```

---

## Calculating coefficients 

Just like with univariate regression, we calculate the OLS solution. As a reminder, this calculation will yield the estimate that reduces the sum of the squared deviations from the line:

.pull-left[
### Unstandardized
$$\small \hat{Y} = b_0 + b_{1}X1 + b_{2}X_2$$
$$\small \text{minimize} \sum (Y-\hat{Y})^2 $$
]
.pull-right[

### Standardized
$$\small \hat{Z}_{Y} = b_{1}^*Z_{X1} + b_{2}^*Z_{X2}$$
$$\small \text{minimize} \sum (z_{Y}-\hat{z}_{Y})^2$$
]

---
## Calculating the standardized partial regression coefficient 

$$b_{1}^* = \frac{r_{Y1}-r_{Y2}r_{12}}{1-r_{12}^2}$$

$$b_{2}^* = \frac{r_{Y2}-r_{Y1}r_{12}}{1-r_{12}^2}$$
---
## Notice the similarity with semi-partial correlation

$$b_{1}^* = \frac{r_{Y1}-r_{Y2}r_{12}}{1-r_{12}^2}$$



$$sr = r_{y(1.2)} = \frac{r_{Y1}-r_{Y2}r_{Y12} }{\sqrt{1-r_{12}^2}}$$


---

### Relationships between partial, semi- and b*  

All ways to represent the relationship between two variables while taking into account a third (or more!) variables. 

  - Each is a standardized effect, bounded by -1 and 1*. This means they can be compared.

Not equal calculations!

  - If predictors are not correlated, $r$,  sr $(r_{Y(1.2)})$ and b* are equal 

.small[*Standardized regression coefficients are not bounded by -1 and 1, but it's rare and usually a problem ]
---

** Standardized mult regression coefficient** $b^*$

$$\frac{r_{Y1}-r_{Y2}r_{12}}{1-r_{12}^2}$$


** Semi-partial correlation** $r_{y(1.2)}$
$$\frac{r_{Y1}-r_{Y2}r_{Y12} }{\sqrt{1-r_{12}^2}}$$

** Partial correlation** $r_{y1.2}$
$$\frac{r_{Y1}-r_{Y2}r_{{12}}}{\sqrt{1-r^2_{Y2}}\sqrt{1-r^2_{12}}}$$
---

```{r, echo=FALSE}
z_score = function(x){
  m = mean(x, na.rm=T)
  s = sd(x, na.rm=T)
  z = (x-m)/s
  return(z)
}

stress.data = stress.data %>%
  mutate(z_anxiety = z_score(Anxiety),
         z_support = z_score(Support),
         z_stress = z_score(Stress))
```

```{r}
mod0 = lm(z_stress ~ z_anxiety + z_support, 
          data = stress.data)

round(coef(mod0),3)
```

.pull-left[
```{r, message=F, warning = F, echo = 2:4}
library(ppcor)
spcor.test(x = stress.data$Anxiety, 
           y = stress.data$Stress, 
           z = stress.data$Support)$estimate
```
]

.pull-right[

```{r, message=F, warning = F}
pcor.test(x = stress.data$Anxiety, 
          y = stress.data$Stress, 
          z = stress.data$Support)$estimate
```

]

They're not the same, but they're close!

## Review

.pull-left[

#### Original Metric

$$b_{1} = b_{1}^*\frac{s_{Y}}{s_{X1}}$$

$$b_{1}^* = b_{1}\frac{s_{X1}}{s_{Y}}$$
]

.pull-right[

#### Intercept

$$b_{0} = \bar{Y} - b_{1}\bar{X_{1}} - b_{2}\bar{X_{2}}$$

]

## Multiple correlation, R

$$\large \hat{Y} = b_{0} + b_{1}X_{1} + b_{2}X_{2}$$


- $\hat{Y}$ is a linear combination of Xs
- $r_{Y\hat{Y}}$ = multiple correlation = R

--

$$\large R = \sqrt{b_{1}^*r_{Y1} + b_{2}^*r_{Y2}}$$
$$\large R^2 = {b_{1}^*r_{Y1} + b_{2}^*r_{Y2}}$$

## Decomposing sums of squares

We haven't changed our method of decomposing variance from the univariate model

$$\Large \frac{SS_{regression}}{SS_{Y}} = R^2$$
$$\Large {SS_{regression}} = R^2({SS_{Y})}$$



$$\Large {SS_{residual}} = (1- R^2){SS_{Y}}$$
  
---

## Significance tests

- $R^2$ (omnibus)  
- Regression Coefficients  
- Increments to $R^2$  
    
---

## R-squared, $R^2$


- Same interpretation as before  

- Adding predictors into your model will increase $R^2$ – regardless of whether or not the predictor is significantly correlated with Y.    

- Adjusted/Shrunken $R^2$ takes into account the number of predictors in your model  


---

## Adjusted R-squared, $\text{Adj} R^2$

$$\large R_{A}^2 = 1 - \frac{Var_{res}}{Var_{total}}$$


$$\large R_{A}^2 = 1 - \frac{\frac{SS_{res}}{n-p-1}}{\frac{SS_{total}}{n-1}}$$
$$\large R_{A}^2 = 1 - (1 -R^2)\frac{n-1}{n-p-1}$$
---

## Adjusted R-squared, $\text{Adj} R^2$

$$\large R_{A}^2 = 1 - (1 -R^2)\frac{n-1}{n-p-1}$$
- What happens if you add many IV's to your model that are uncorrelated with your DV?

--


- What happens as you add more covariates to your model that are highly correlated with your key predictor, X?

$$b_{1}^* = \frac{r_{Y1}-r_{Y2}r_{12}}{1-r_{12}^2}$$

## ANOVA

summary(mr.model)

## ANOVA

## Test of individual regression coefficients

$$\Large H_{0}: \beta_{X}= 0$$
$$\Large H_{1}: \beta_{X} \neq 0$$

---

### Test of individual regression coefficients

In the case of univariate regression:

$$se_{b} = \frac{s_{Y}}{s_{X}}{\sqrt{\frac {1-r_{xy}^2}{n-2}}}$$

In the case of multiple regression:

$$se_{b} = \frac{s_{Y}}{s_{X}}{\sqrt{\frac {1-R_{Y\hat{Y}}^2}{n-p-1}}} \sqrt{\frac {1}{1-R_{i.jkl...p}^2}}$$

- As N increases... 
- As variance explained increases...
