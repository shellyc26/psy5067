## Last time/this time

- Looked at glm models and showed how they are the same as our old friends, *t*-tests and ANOVAs, just with categorical predictors

- Moving toward continuous predictor models
---
## Relationships

- What is the relationship between IV and DV?

- Measuring relationships depend on type of measurement

- You have primarily been working with categorical IVs (*t*-test, chi-square)

class: center

Formula for standard error of the mean?

--

$$\sigma_M = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N}}$$

$$\sigma_M = \frac{\hat{s}}{\sqrt{N}}$$

---
## Associations

- i.e., relationships
- to look at continuous variable associations we need to think in terms of how variables relate to one another

---
## Associations

Covariation (cross products)

**Sample:**

$$\large SS = {\sum{(x-\bar{x})(y-\bar{y})}}$$

**Population:**

$$SS = {\sum{{(x-\mu_{x}})(y-\mu_{y})}}$$

---
## Associations

Covariance

**Sample:**

$$\large cov_{xy} = {\frac{\sum{(x-\bar{x})(y-\bar{y})}}{N-1}}$$

**Population:**

$$\large \sigma_{xy}^{2} = {\frac{\sum{(x-\mu_{x})(y-\mu_{y})}}{N}}$$

--
>- Covariance matrix is basis for many analyses
>- What are some issues that may arise when comparing covariances?

---
## Associations
Correlations

**Sample:**

$$\large r_{xy} = {\frac{\sum({z_{x}z_{y})}}{N}}$$

**Population:**

$$\large \rho_{xy} = {\frac{cov(X,Y)}{\sigma_{x}\sigma_{y}}}$$


Many other formulas exist for specific types of data, these were more helpful when we computed everything by hand (more on this later).

---

## Correlations


- How much two variables are linearly related

- -1 to 1

- Invariant to changes in mean or scaling

- Most common (and basic) effect size measure

- Will use to build our regression model

---

## Conceptually 

Ways to think about a correlation:

* How two vectors of numbers co-relate

* Product of z-scores
  
  + Mathematically, it is
  
* The average squared distance between two vectors in the same space

---

## Correlations

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

- This will become our regression line. Right now, it is our correlation line. At this point **they are the same!**
- Correlation summarizes the association btwn 2 continuous variables
- We will use this to build up our regression model, but in the mean time, you can do a lot of things with just correlations.
]

## Statistical test

Hypothesis testing

$$\large H_{0}: \rho_{xy} = 0$$

$$\large H_{A}: \rho_{xy} \neq 0$$

Assumes:
- Observations are independent
- Symmetric bivariate distribution (joint probability distribution)

```

---

### Sampling distribution?

--

The sampling distribution we use depends on our null hypothesis.

--

If our null hypothesis is that $(\rho = 0)$ , then we can use a ***t*-distribution** to estimate the statistical significance of a correlation. 



---
## Test Statistic
As with most all test statistics, they take the form of "signal" divided by "noise". Standard error is interpreted like other standard errors we've seen.

$$\large t = {\frac{r}{SE_{r}}}$$
--
.pull-left[
$$\large SE_r = \sqrt{\frac{1-r^2}{N-2}}$$

$$\large t = {\frac{r}{\sqrt{\frac{1-r^{2}}{N-2}}}}$$
]

.pull-right[
$$\large DF = N-2$$
]

---
## Power calculations
What sample size do you need in order to have enough power to detect a .1 correlation? .3?
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(pwr)
pwr.r.test(n = , r = .1, sig.level = .05 , power = .8)
pwr.r.test(n = , r = .3, sig.level = .05 , power = .8)
```

---
## Power calculations
- But what is your confidence?

- N = 84 gives you CI[.09, .48]

- Sch√∂nbrodt & Perugini (2013) suggest correlations 'stabilize' at 250+ regardless of effect size

- CI[.19, .39]

## Fisher's r to z' transformation

- Skewed sampling distribution will rear its head when:

    * $H_{0}: \rho \neq 0$

    * Calculating confidence intervals

    * Testing two correlations against one another

- r to z':

$$\large z^{'} = {\frac{1}{2}}ln{\frac{1+r}{1-r}}$$

---
## Fisher‚Äôs r to z‚Äô transformation

```{r, echo = F}
r = seq(-.99,.99,.01)
z = psych::fisherz(r)
data.frame(r,z) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = r, y = z)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_continuous(expr(r))+
  scale_y_continuous(expr(z_r))+
  theme_bw(base_size = 20)
```


---
##  Steps for computing confidence interval

1. Transform r into z'
2. Compute CI as you normally would using z'
3. revert back to r

$$ SE_z = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N-3}}$$

$$\large r = {\frac{e^{2z'}-1}{e^{2z'}+1}}$$
---

### Example

In a sample of 42 students, you calculate a correlation of 0.44 between hours spent outside on Saturday and self-rated health. What is the precision of your estimate?

```{r, echo = F}
r = .44
N = 42
z = fisherz(r)
se = 1/(sqrt(N-3))
ct = qt(p = .975, df = N-2, lower.tail = T)
lbz = z-(se*ct)
ubz = z+(se*ct)
lb = fisherz2r(lbz)
ub = fisherz2r(ubz)
```


.pull-left[
$$z^{'} = {\frac{1}{2}}ln{\frac{1+.44}{1-.44}} = `r round(z,2)`$$
$$SE_z = \frac{1}{\sqrt{42-3}} = `r round(se,2)`$$

$$CI_{Z_{LB}} = `r round(z,2)`-(`r round(ct,3)`)`r round(se,2)` = `r round(lbz,2)`$$

$$CI_{Z_{UB}} = `r round(z,2)`+(`r round(ct,3)`)`r round(se,2)` = `r round(ubz,2)`$$
]

---


$$CI_{r_{LB}} = {\frac{e^{2(`r round(lbz,2)`)}-1}{e^{2(`r round(lbz,2)`)}+1}} = `r round(lb,2)`$$

$$CI_{r_{UB}} = = {\frac{e^{2(`r round(ubz,2)`)}-1}{e^{2(`r round(ubz,2)`)}+1}} = `r round(ub,2)`$$

---
## How to do in R

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(psych)
fisherz(r)
fisherz2r(z)
```

---

## Two independent group test

- Does the correlation in group 1 differ from the correlation in group 2?

$$ H_A: \rho_1 = \rho_2 $$

$$ H_A: \rho_1 \neq \rho_2 $$

- Normally distributed

$$Z = \frac{z_1^{'}- z_2^{'}}{se_{z_1-z_2}}$$

---
## Comparing two correlations

Again, we use the Fisher‚Äôs r to z‚Äô transformation. Here, we're transforming the correlations into z's, then using the difference between z's to calculate the test statistic. 

$$Z = \frac{z_1^{'}- z_2^{'}}{se_{z_1-z_2}}$$

$$se_{z_1-z_2} = \sqrt{se_{z_1}+se_{z_2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1-3}+\frac{1}{n_2-3}}$$

- But probably best to do this test in another framework (e.g., GLM via interaction or SEM)
---

## Example

Replication of Hill et al. (2012) where they found that the correlation between narcissism and happiness was greater for young adults compared to older adults

.pull-left[
### Young adults
$$N = 327$$
$$r = .402$$
]

.pull-right[
### Older adults
$$N = 273$$
$$r = .283$$
]



$$H_0:\rho_1 = \rho_2$$
$$H_1:\rho_1 \neq \rho_2$$

---

```{r, echo = F}
z1 = fisherz(.402)
z2 = fisherz(.283)
n1 = 327
n2 = 273
se = sqrt(1/(n1-3) + 1/(n2-3))

zstat = (z1-z2)/se
```


$$z_1^{'} = {\frac{1}{2}}ln{\frac{1+.402}{1-.402}} = `r round(z1,3)`$$

$$z_2^{'} = {\frac{1}{2}}ln{\frac{1+.283}{1-.283}} = `r round(z2,3)`$$

$$se_{z_1-z_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{327-3}+\frac{1}{273-3}} = `r round(se,3)`$$

$$\text{Test statistic} = \frac{z_1^{'}-z_2^{'}}{se_{z_1-z_2}} = \frac{`r round(z1,3)`- `r round(z2,3)`}{`r round(se,3)`} = `r round(zstat,3)`$$

```{r}
pnorm(abs(zstat), lower.tail = F)*2
```

## Effect size

- The strength of relationship between two variables

- $\eta^2$, Cohen‚Äôs d, Cohen‚Äôs f, hedges g, $R^2$ , Risk-ratio, etc

- Significance is a function of effect size and sample size

- Statistical significance $\neq$ practical significance

---
## Effect size
How big is practical?

- Cohen (.1, .3., .5)
- Meyer & Hemphill .3 is average
- Rosenthaul:

Drug TX?  | Alive |  Dead
----------|-------|--------
Treatment |  65   |  35
No Tx     |  35   |  65

- Combat exposure and PTSD?
- Ibuprofen on pain reduction?
- Gender and weight?
- Therapy and well being?
- Observer ratings of attractiveness?
- Gender and arm strength?
- Nearness to equator and daily temperature for U.S.?

## Questions to ask yourself:
- What is your N?
- What is the typical effect size in the field?
- Study design?
- What is your DV?
- Importance?
- Same method as IV (method variance)?

---
## Correlation matrices

Correlations are both a descriptive and an inferential statistic. As a descriptive statistic, they're useful for understanding what's going on in a larger dataset. 

Like we use the `summary()` or `describe()` (psych) functions to examine our dataset _before we run any infernetial tests_, we should also look at the correlation matrix. 

---

```{r}
library(psych)
data(bfi)
head(bfi)
```

---

```{r}
cor(bfi)
```

---

```{r}
round(cor(bfi, use = "pairwise"),2)
```

---

```{r}
round(cor(bfi, use = "complete"),2)
```

---

With **pairwise deletion**, different sets of cases contribute to different correlations.  That maximizes the sample sizes, but can lead to problems if the data are missing for some systematic reason.

**Listwise deletion** (often referred to in `R` as use complete cases) doesn't have the same issue of biasing correlations, but does result in smaller samples and potentially limited generalizability.

A good practice is comparing the different matrices; if the correlation values are very different, this suggests that the missingness that affects pairwise deletion is systematic.

---

```{r}
round(cor(bfi, use = "pairwise")- cor(bfi, use = "complete"),2)
```
---

## Visualizing correlations

For a single correlation, best practice is to visualize the relationship using a scatterplot. A best fit line is advised, as it can help clarify the strength and direction of the relationship.

## Visualizing correlation matrices

A single correlation can be informative; a correlation matrix is more than the sum of its parts. 

Correlation matrices can be used to infer larger patterns of relationships. You may be one of the gifted who can look at a matrix of numbers and see those patterns immediately. Or you can use **heat maps** to visualize correlation matrices. 

```{r, results = 'hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(corrplot)
```

---

```{r}
corrplot(cor(bfi, use = "pairwise"), method = "square")
```

## Other correlation tests:
1. Set of correlations
2. Dependent correlations (i.e., within same group)
  These are more easily tested via Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)
3. Intra Class Correlation (ICC)

- Again, best to do these tests in another framework (e.g., interaction, SEM, MLM)

---
## Factors that influence r (and most other test statistics)

1. Restriction of range (GRE scores and success)

2. Very skewed distributions (smoking and health)

3. Non-linear associations

4. Measurement overlap (modality and content)

5. Reliability

---
## Reliability


Which would you rather have?

  - 1-item final exam versus 30-item?

  - assessment via trained clinician vs tarot cards?

  - fMRI during minor earthquake vs no earthquake?

--

All measurement includes error

- Score = true score + measurement error (CTT version)

- Reliability assesses the consistency of measurement; high reliability indicates less error

---

## Reliability

- Error is random; it cannot correlate with something

- Because we don't measure our variables perfectly, we get lower correlations compared to true correlations

- If we want to have a valid measure it better be a reliable measure

---
## Reliability

- think of reliability as a correlation with a measure and itself in a different world, at a different time, or a different but equal version

$$\large r_{XX}$$

---
## Reliability

- true score variance divided by observed variance
- how do you assess theoretical variance i.e., true score variance?

$$\large r_{XY} = r_{X_{T} Y_{T}} {\sqrt{r_{XX}r_{YY}}}$$

$$\large r_{XY} = .6 {\sqrt {(.70) (.70)}}$$

---
## Reliability

$$\large r_{X_{T} Y_{T}} =  = {\frac {r_{XY}} {\sqrt{r_{XX}r_{YY}}}}$$


$$\large r_{X_{T} Y_{T}} =  = {\frac {.30} {\sqrt{(.70)(.70)}}} = .42$$


???

### Take aways

N needed for .42 = 42
N needed for .3 = 84 -- need twice as many people!!

it doesn't work the other way -- you can't take your correlation and back calculate the true score, because reliabilities are also estimates. these can be wrong; the correlation you calculate is the max it could bep

---
## Most common ways to assess

- cronbachs alpha
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library (psych)
alpha(measure)
## Gives average split half correlation
## Can tell you if you are assessing a single construct
```
- test - retest reliability
- Kappa or ICC

---
## Reliability

- if you are going to measure something, do it well

- applies to ALL IVs and DVs, and all designs

- remember this when interpreting other research

---
## Types of correlations

- Many ways to get at relationship between two variables

- Statistically the different types are almost exactly the same

- Exist for historical reasons

---

## Types of correlations
1. Point Biserial
    +  continuous and dichtomous
2. Phi coefficient
    + both dichotomous
3. Spearman rank order
    + ranked data (nonparametric)
4. Biserial (assumes dichotomous is continous)
5. Tetrachoric (assumes dichotomous is continous)
    + both dichotomous
6. Polychoric (assumes continous)
    + ordinal

## Next time....

Univariate regression

(remaining slides include more examples, if you want some practice)

### Example

The correlation between midterm exam grades and final exam grades was .56. The class size was 104. Is this statistically significant?

```{r, echo = F}
N = 104
r = .56

se = sqrt((1-r^2)/(N-2))

p1 = pt(r/se, df = N-2, lower.tail = F)
```


--
### Using t-method

$$\large SE_r = \sqrt{\frac{1-r^2}{N-2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1-.56^2}{104-2}} = `r round(se,2)`$$
$$\large t = \frac{r}{SE_r} = \frac{`r round(r,2)`}{`r round(se,2)`} = `r round(r/se,2)`$$

---


.left-column[
Probability of getting a *t* statistic of `r round(r/se,2)` or greater is `r p1`.

Probability of getting *t* statistic of `r round(r/se,2)` or more extreme is `r p1*2`.
]

```{r, echo = F, message = F, warning = F, results='hide'}
library(tidyverse)
data.frame(x = c(-3,7)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x)) +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) dt(x = x, df = N-2), geom = "line") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = r/se), color = "purple") + 
  ggtitle("t distribution (DF = 102)")+
  theme_bw()
```

---

### Example

The correlation between midterm exam grades and final exam grades was .56. The class size was 104. Is this statistically significantly different from .40?

--

```{r, echo = F}
r = .56
N = 104
null = .40
zr = psych::fisherz(r)
znull = psych::fisherz(null)
se = 1/sqrt(N-3)
stat = (zr-znull)/se
```

$$\large z^{'} = {\frac{1}{2}}ln{\frac{1+r}{1-r}}= {\frac{1}{2}}ln{\frac{1+`r r`}{1-`r r`}} = `r round(zr,2)`$$
$$\large z^{'}_{H_0} = {\frac{1}{2}}ln{\frac{1+r}{1-r}}= {\frac{1}{2}}ln{\frac{1+`r null`}{1-`r null`}} = `r round(znull,2)`$$
$$ SE_z = \frac{1}{\sqrt{`r N`-3}} = `r round(se,2)`$$

---

$$Z_{\text{statistic}} = \frac{z'-\mu}{SE_z}=\frac{`r round(zr,2)`-`r round(znull,2)`}{`r round(se,2)`} = `r round(stat,2)`$$

```{r}
stat
pnorm(stat, lower.tail = F)
pnorm(stat, lower.tail = F)*2
```
