```{r, echo = F}
set.seed(23)
SD=120

DV_Slow_N <- rnorm(20,mean=600,sd=SD) # draw 20 from normal distribution
DV_Slow_C <- rnorm(20,mean=590,sd=SD) # draw 20 from normal distribution

Data = data.frame(Time = c(DV_Slow_N,
                           DV_Slow_C,
                           DV_Slow_U,
                           DV_Med_N,
                           DV_Med_C,
                           DV_Med_U,

                  Speed = rep(c("Slow", "Medium", "Fast"), each = 60),
                  Noise = rep(rep(c("None", "Controllable", "Uncontrollable"), 
                                  each = 20), 3)) #repeat each label 20 times, then repeat that whole sequence 3 times
Data$Speed = factor(Data$Speed, levels = c("Slow", "Medium", "Fast")) # set order of levels as I want them presented

.pull-left[
The example data are from a simulated study in which 180 participants performed an eye-hand coordination task in which they were required to keep a mouse pointer on a red dot that moved in a circular motion.  
]
.pull-right[
![](images/dot.jpg)
]

The outcome was the time of the 10th failure. The experiment used a completely crossed, 3 x 3 factorial design. One factor was dot speed: .5, 1, or 1.5 revolutions per second.  The second factor was noise condition: no noise, controllable noise, and uncontrollable noise.  The design was balanced. 
---

### Marginal/cell means

```{r, echo = F, results = 'asis', message = F, warning = F}
mean.summary = Data %>%
  group_by(Noise, Speed) %>%
  summarize(Time = mean(Time)) %>%
  spread("Speed", "Time")
mean.summary$Noise = as.character(mean.summary$Noise)
mean.summary$Marginal = rowMeans(mean.summary[2:4])
mean.summary[4,1] = "Marginal"
mean.summary[4,2:5] = colMeans(mean.summary[2:5], na.rm=T)

kable(mean.summary, digits = 2) %>% 
  kable_styling() %>% 
  group_rows(start_row = 1, end_row = 3) %>%
  column_spec(2, background = "#EECACA") %>%
  column_spec(3, background = "#B2D4EB") %>%
  column_spec(4, background = "#FFFFC5") %>%
  column_spec(5, background = "grey", color = "white") %>%
  row_spec(4, background = "white")
```
---



## Running the analysis of variance

```{r}
fit = lm(Time ~ Speed*Noise, data = Data)
anova(fit)
```

---

```{r}
lsr::etaSquared(fit)
```

An effect size, $\eta^2$, provides a simple way of indexing effect magnitude for ANOVA designs, especially as they get more complex.

$\eta^2$ represents the proportion of variance in Y explained by a single factor (or interaction of factors). It is identical in its calculation to $R^2$:

$$\large \eta^2 = \frac{SS_{\text{effect}}}{SS_{\text{Y}}}$$
---

```{r}
lsr::etaSquared(fit)
```

In an experimental design, variance in Y is created, rather than observed, by manipulating participants. The ways in which an experimenter chooses to manipulate particiapnts can increase or decrease variance in Y, making it difficult to compare the effect of a single manipulation across studies with different designs. 

Partial $\eta^2$ is meant to aid interpretation by considering only the variance associated with an effect and random variablity, which is naturally occuring and not under the control of the experimenter.

$$\large \text{Partial }\eta^2 = \frac{SS_{\text{effect}}}{SS_{\text{effect}} + SS_{\text{within}}}$$

---


### Differences in means

In a factorial design, marginal means or cell means must be calculated in order to interpret main effects and the interaction, respectively. The confidence intervals around those means likewise are needed.

```{r, echo = F, results = 'asis', message = F, warning = F}
mean.summary = Data %>%
  group_by(Noise, Speed) %>%
  summarize(Time = mean(Time)) %>%
  spread("Speed", "Time")
mean.summary$Noise = as.character(mean.summary$Noise)
mean.summary$Marginal = rowMeans(mean.summary[2:4])
mean.summary[4,1] = "Marginal"
mean.summary[4,2:5] = colMeans(mean.summary[2:5], na.rm=T)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
kable(mean.summary, digits = 2) %>% kable_styling() %>% group_rows(start_row = 1, end_row = 3)
```

These means will be based on different sample sizes, which has an impact on the width of the confidence interval.

---

### Precision

If the homogeneity of variances assumption holds, a common estimate of score variability $(MS_{within})$ underlies all of the confidence intervals. 

$$\large SE_{mean} = \sqrt{\frac{MS_{within}}{N}}$$

$$\large CI_{mean} = Mean \pm t_{df_{within}, \alpha = .05}\sqrt{\frac{MS_{within}}{N}}$$

The sample size, $N$, depends on how many cases are aggregated to create the mean.

The $MS_{within}$ is common to all calculations if homogeneity of variances is met.  The degrees of freedom for $MS_{within}$ determine the value of $t$ to use.
---

```{r, message = F}
anova(fit)
```
---
```{r, message = F}
library(emmeans)
(time_rg = ref_grid(fit))
summary(time_rg)
```

---
The lsmeans( ) function produces marginal and cell means along with their confidence intervals. These are the marginal means for the Noise main effect.

```{r}
noise_lsm = emmeans::lsmeans(time_rg, "Noise")
noise_lsm
```



---

```{r, message=F, warning=F, fig.width=10, fig.height=6, echo = T}
library(sjPlot)
noise_m = plot_model(fit, type = "emm", terms = c("Noise")) + 
  theme_sjplot(base_size = 20)
speed_m = plot_model(fit, type = "emm", terms = c("Speed")) + 
  theme_sjplot(base_size = 20)
library(ggpubr)
ggarrange(noise_m, speed_m, ncol = 2)
```

---

```{r, message=F, warning=F, fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
plot_model(fit, type = "pred", terms = c("Speed", "Noise")) + 
  theme_sjplot(base_size = 20) + theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```
---

### Precision

A reminder that comparing the confidence intervals for two means (overlap) is not the same as the confidence interval for the difference between two means. 


$$
\begin{aligned}
\large SE_{\text{mean}} &= \sqrt{\frac{MS_{within}}{N}}\\
\large SE_{\text{mean difference}} &= \sqrt{MS_{within}[\frac{1}{N_1}+\frac{1}{N_2}]} \\
\large SE_{\text{mean difference}} &= \sqrt{\frac{2MS_{within}}{N}} \\
\end{aligned}
$$
---

### Cohen's D

$\eta^2$ is useful for comparing the relative effect sizes of one factor to another. If you want to compare the differences between groups, Cohen's d is the more appropriate metric. Like in a t-test, you'll divide the differences in means by the pooled standard deviation. The pooled variance estimate is the $MS_{error}$

```{r}
fit = lm(Time ~ Speed*Noise, data = Data)
anova(fit)[,"Mean Sq"]
MS_error = anova(fit)[,"Mean Sq"][4]
```

So to get the pooled standard deviation:

```{r}
pooled_sd = sqrt(MS_error)
```

---

### Cohen's D

```{r}
(noise_df = as.data.frame(noise_lsm))

(d_none_control = diff(noise_df[c(1,2), "lsmean"])/pooled_sd)
```




---

### Follow-up comparisons

Interpretation of the main effects and interaction in a factorial design will usually require follow-up comparisons.  These need to be conducted at the level of the effect.

Interpretation of a main effect requires comparisons among the marginal means.

Interpretation of the interaction requires comparisons among the cell means.

The `emmeans` package makes these comparisons very easy to conduct.

---

```{r}
noise_lsm = emmeans::lsmeans(time_rg, "Noise")
pairs(noise_lsm, adjust = "holm")
```

---

## Assumptions

You can check the assumptions of the factorial ANOVA in much the same way you check them for multiple regression; but given the categorical nature of the predictors, some assumptions are easier to check.

Homogeneity of variance, for example, can be tested using Levene's test, instead of examining a plot.

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
library(car)
leveneTest(Time ~ Speed*Noise, data = Data)
```

---

## Unbalanced designs

If designs are balanced, then the main effects and interpretation effects are independent/orthogonal. In other words, knowing what condition a case is in on Variable 1 will not make it any easier to guess what condition they were part of in Variable 2. 

However, if your design is unbalanced, the main effects and interaction effect are partly confounded. 

```{r, echo = F}
set.seed(23)
SD=120

DV_Soft_C <- rnorm(10,mean=590,sd=SD) # draw 10 from normal distribution
DV_Soft_U <- rnorm(30,mean=585,sd=SD) # draw 30 from normal distribution

DV_Loud_C <- rnorm(20,mean=450,sd=SD) # draw 20 from normal
DV_Loud_U <- rnorm(20,mean=300,sd=SD) # draw 20 from normal



# put DVs together in a Data2 frame; specify Speed and Noise Values
Data2 = data.frame(Time = c(DV_Soft_U,
                           DV_Soft_C,
                           DV_Loud_U,
                           DV_Loud_C),
                  Level = rep(c("Soft", "Loud"), each = 40),
                  Noise = c(rep("Controllable", 10), 
                            rep("Uncontrollable", 30), 
                            rep(c("Controllable", "Uncontrollable"), each = 20)))
Data2$Level = factor(Data2$Level, levels = c("Soft", "Loud")) # set order of levels as I want them presented
Data2$Noise = factor(Data2$Noise, levels = c("Controllable", "Uncontrollable")) # set order of levels as I want them presented
```

```{r}
table(Data2$Level, Data2$Noise)
```

### Sums of Squares

.pull-left[
In a Venn diagram, the overlap represents the variance shared by the variables. Now there is variance accounted for in the outcome (Time) that cannot be unambiguously attributed to just one of the predictors There are several options for handling the ambiguous regions.]
.pull-right[
![](images/eta_sq_unbalanced.jpg)
]
---

### Sums of Squares (III)

.pull-left[
![](images/eta_sq_unbalanced_iii.jpg)]

.pull-right[
There are three basic ways that overlapping variance accounted for in the outcome can be handled.  These are known as Type I, Type II, and Type III sums of squares. 

Type III sums of squares is the easiest to understand—the overlapping variance accounted for goes unclaimed by any variable.  Effects can only account for the unique variance that they share with the outcome.
]

---

### Sums of Squares (I)

.pull-left[
Type I sums of squares allocates the overlapping variance according to some priority rule.  All of the variance is claimed, but the rule needs to be justified well or else suspicions about p-hacking are likely.  The rule might be based on theory or causal priority or methodological argument.

### Sums of Squares (I)
If a design is quite unbalanced, different orders of effects can produce quite different results.

```{r}
fit_1 = aov(Time ~ Noise + Level, data = Data2)
summary(fit_1)
lsr::etaSquared(fit_1, type = 1)
```

---
### Sums of Squares (I)
If a design is quite unbalanced, different orders of effects can produce quite different results.

```{r}
fit_1 = aov(Time ~ Level + Noise, data = Data2)
summary(fit_1)
lsr::etaSquared(fit_1, type = 1)
```

---
### Sums of Squares (II)

Type II sums of squares are the most commonly used but also a bit more complex to understand.  

An approximately true description is that an effect is allocated the proportion of variance in the outcome that is unshared with effects at a similar or lower level.

A technically correct description is that a target effect is allocated the proportion of variance in the outcome that is unshared with other effects that do not contain the target.

---
### Sums of Squares (II)

In an A x B design, the A effect is the proportion of variance that is accounted for by A after removing the variance accounted for by B.

The A x B interaction is allocated the proportion of variance that is accounted for by A x B after removing the variance accounted for by A and B.

There is no convenient way to illustrate this in a Venn diagram.

---

### Sums of Squares

Let R(·) represent the residual sum of squares for a model, so for example R(A,B,AB) is
the residual sum of squares fitting the whole model, R(A) is the residual sum of squares 
fitting just the main effect of A, and R(1) is the residual sum of squares fitting just the
mean. 

| Effect | Type I            | Type II           | Type III            |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| A      | R(1)-R(A)         | R(B)-R(A,B)       | R(B,A:B)-R(A,B,A:B) |
| B      | R(A)-R(A,B)       | R(A)-R(A,B)       | R(A,A:B)-R(A,B,A:B) |
| A:B    | R(A,B)-R(A,B,A:B) | R(A,B)-R(A,B,A:B) | R(A,B)-R(A,B,A:B)   |

---

### Sums of Squares

Let R(·) represent the residual sum of squares for a model, so for example R(A,B,AB) is
the residual sum of squares fitting the whole model, R(A) is the residual sum of squares 
fitting just the main effect of A, and R(1) is the residual sum of squares fitting just the
mean. 

| Effect | Type I            | Type II           | Type III            |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| A      | SS(A)         | SS(A&#124;B)       | SS(A&#124;B,AB) |
| B      | SS(B&#124;A)       | SS(B&#124;A)       | SS(B&#124;A,AB) |
| A:B    | SS(AB&#124;A,B)    | SS(AB&#124;A,B)    | SS(AB&#124;A,B)   |

---

The `aov( )` function in R produces Type I sums of squares. The `Anova( )` function from the car package provides Type II and Type III sums of squares.

These work as expected provided the predictors are factors.

```{r}
Anova(aov(fit), type = "II")
```



---

All of the between-subjects variance is accounted for by an effect in Type I sums of squares.  The sums of squares for each effect and the residual will equal the total sum of squares.

For Type II and Type III sums of squares, the sums of squares for effects and residual will be less than the total sum of squares. Some variance (in the form of SS) goes unclaimed.

The highest order effect (assuming standard ordering) has the same SS in all three models.

When a design is balanced, Type I, II, and III sums of squares are equivalent.

---

## Summary (and Regression)

Factorial ANOVA is the method by which we can examine whether two (or more) categorical IVs have joint effects on a continuous outcome of interest. Like all general linear models, factorial ANOVA is a specific case of multiple regression. However, we may choose to use an ANOVA framework for the sake of interpretability. 

---

.pull-left[
#### Factorial ANOVA

Interaction tests whether there are differences in differences.

A main effect is the effect of one IV on the DV **ignoring the other variable(s)**.
]
.pull-right[
#### Regression

Interaction tests whether slope changes. 

A conditional effect is the effect of IV on the DV **assuming all the other variables are 0**.
]

## Power

What is (statistical) power? How can we increase power?

--

The likelihood of finding an effect *if the effect actually exists.* Power gets larger as we:
* increase our sample size
* reduce (error) variance
* raise our Type I error rate
* study larger effects


---

```{r, echo = F, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8, message = F}
library(tidyverse)
mu = 100
s = 20
mean = 110
n = 20
sem = s/sqrt(n)
cv = qnorm(mean = mu, sd = sem, p = .05, lower.tail = F)

ggplot(data.frame(x = seq(70, 130)), aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) dnorm(x, m = mu, sd = sem)) +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) dnorm(x, m = mean, sd = sem)) +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) dnorm(x, m = mean, sd = sem),
                geom = "area", xlim = c(cv, 130), 
                aes(fill = "Power"), alpha = .5) +
  #geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mu))+
  #geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean))+
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0))+
  scale_x_continuous("Means", breaks = seq(70,130,10)) +
  scale_y_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL) + 
  guides(color = F)+
  theme_bw()+
  theme( text = element_text(size = 20))
```

---

## Power in multiple regression (additive effects)

When calculating power for the omnibus test, use the expected multiple $R^2$ value to calculate an effect size:

$$\large f^2 = \frac{R^2}{1-R^2}$$
---

### Omnibus power
```{r}
R2 = .10
(f = R2/(1-R2))
library(pwr)
pwr.f2.test(u = 3, # number of predictors in the model
            f2 = f, 
            sig.level = .05, #alpha
            power =.90) # desired power
```

`v` is the denominator df of freedom, so the number of participants needed is v + p + 1.

---

### Coefficient power

To estimate power for a single coefficient, you need to consider (1) how much variance is accounted for by just the variable and (2) how much variance you'll account for in Y overall.

$$\large f^2 = \frac{R^2_Y-R^2_{Y.X}}{1-R_Y^2}$$
---
### Coefficient power

```{r}
R2 = .10
RX1 = .03
(f = (R2-RX1)/(1-R2))
pwr.f2.test(u = 3, # number of predictors in the model
            f2 = f, 
            sig.level = .05, #alpha
            power =.90) # desired power
```

`v` is the denominator df of freedom, so the number of participants needed is v + p + 1.
