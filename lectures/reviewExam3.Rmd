## Thought questions

.tiny[Spend roughly 10-15 minutes with friends describing each. Be as thorough as possible]

.small[


- nEEDS TO BE MLM

- What is the problem resampling methods help us overcome? Can you describe the process? If I gave you a snippet of code, could you read it through and more or less understand what is going on? 

- What problem is logistic regression trying to solve? Why can't we use linear regression? How do we derive our coefficients in logistic regression? Can you interpret the output? How do you convert to probabilities, odds, etc? 

- What was the main takeaway from Yarkoni & Westfall? What is cross-validation, overfitting, and regularization? When can we implement these tools? What is the bias-variance tradeoff and how does that relate to the terms listed earlier?

## Final Exam

What it covers:

- Heavily weighted towards the last unit, but stuff from earlier in the semester (maybe even 1 or 2 things from Fall semester) creep in.
- Similar to all the exams thus far...nothing new; more writing heavy
- Knowing what to use and when to use it!

--

What it doesn't cover:

- `R` code
- Very specific things from the Fall
- Very specific things from Exams 1 & 2 -- we've built up from there

## Mandatory

Research Designs & Methods (Psych 5011) with Ian Dobbins

- Required for Psych
- If you're not in Psych, you should email him... 

---

## In Psychological & Brain Sciences 

If `R` was really hard and you don't know what you're doing still...
- Applied Statistical Analysis with R (Psych 4175) with me!

--

If you are ready to take the next steps...
- Selected Topics in Design and Statistics (Psych 5012) with Mike Strube
- Hierarchical Linear Models (Psych 5068) with Mike Strube
- Applied Multivariate Analysis (Psych 516) with Mike Strube
- Applied Longitudinal Data Analysis (Psych 5065) with Josh Jackson
- Applied Bayesian Statistics for Psychologists	(Psych 5167) with Josh Jackson

---

## Outside Psychological & Brain Sciences

Cognitive, Computational, and Systems Neuroscience
- ACCSN (BME 519) with me and Dennis Barbour

--

The Brown School
- Structural Equation Modeling
- Survival Analysis
- DON'T take Biostats or Applied Linear Modeling

--

Political Science, Biostatistics (on med campus) exist, but I'm not familiar with those classes

--

New program in Division of Computational & Data Sciences

---

## Wanna be a showoff? 

Graduate Certificate in Quantitative Data Analysis

- Students must be enrolled in programs in Psychology, Economics, Education, or Anthropology
- If that isn't you, it still has a good list of classes to take!
