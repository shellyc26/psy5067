The variables in this study were painstakingly coded by an army of undergrads who read the transcripts of people negotiating.  The two graduate students who ran the coding process both left academia and didn’t keep their files.  We had the reliability data about all the variables except one, by digging out an early version of the manuscript write-up, but one variable was added later and now we’ll never know.  The lesson here is for multiple collaborators to keep the data in their files, although I’ll admit that sometimes I still neglect to do this with student coauthors and really should.","targetRectangle":{"y":377.47836303710938,"x":145.20000170389812,"width":1098.9792,"height":345.71128842314079}},{"text":"I had a grad school classmate who coded participant “sex” as 0\/1 and later forgot which direction was which.
