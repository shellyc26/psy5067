I would know that he always shared this incidence with my friend and I believe that's why I wouldn't be able to get over it.  That no matter what happened between us, he would be able to flash back to that moment.  Maybe to compare us, or maybe just an flashback to that night.  Maybe it's because I believe that sex can never be just sex.  What if she was sad and needed comforting, would he be willing to text her back?  I would break up with him and then try to stay strong, but it would be a break-up so I know the loneliness would hurt me.  At this point in my relationship, I know my boyfriend would be beside himself and be trying to get me back.  That would make me feel good so I can honestly not say if I would let him back in.  If I remained strong and didnt' get back together with him, I would know I made the right decision once the pain subsided.  If I broke down and allowed us to date again I don't know if things would every be the same.  I'd always be angry when I was around him.  I think it would take at least a year (if we lasted that long) for the angry to subside and hopefully the trust to return.",7,3,4,2,He didn't cheat.  But he broke up with me for personal (family & stress) reasons and I felt very betrayed because I knew he loved me.,21,1,"Fine.  I was confused after the audio part about whether I was supposed to answer how I actually felt after hearing the situation, or how I would feel imagining myself in that scenario using the first-person scenario.  (For the record, I answered as if that situation didn't really happen, but I heard it and imagined in for 1 min.)  Also, it didn't affect me but you spelled ""lose"" ""loose"" up above, and in one question you switched the numbers 4 & 5 on the scale.  Just thought you should no.","Not really.  I realized after that I never talked about my friend in the situation.  Probably something you're looking for, but I would definitely blame my boyfriend more for the scenario (which is probably why I didn't mention the friend).  But regarding the friend, I don't think I would ever be her friend again but maybe we would eventually be able to be civil.",No.,I don't really know.  Perhaps about whether the friend or the partner is to be blamed more.  Or to measure whether stable relationships or less stable relationships affect the reaction to the scenario.  3rd variable being mood before and/or after hearing the audio.  You could possibly take people's opinions on sex as well.
