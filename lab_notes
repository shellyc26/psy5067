notes for lab materials

Lab 2: Univariate Regression *CORY*

saving lm() output as a list 
  * how to explore this using View()
  * specific functions for extracting information
      * coefficients(mod.1)       # coefficients
      * residuals(mod.1)          # residuals
      * fitted.values(mod.1)      # fitted values ie predicted
      * summary(mod.1)$r.squared  # R-sq for the model
      * summary(mod.1)$sigma      # se of the model
  * broom::tidy() and broom::augment()
    * reason for using these is that extracting information from lm() output is messy -- list form, missingness problems
    
APA worthy tables
  * stargazer::stargazer()
    * can you make this work with an HTML RMarkdown?
    * using `out = file.html` argument to save to external file (show them how to open with Word)
  * sjPlot::tab_model()
    * using argument `file = file.doc` argument to save to external file
    * this one doesn't work with Rmarkdown (that saves using pandoc, which is what's used to create HTML and Word files)

Lab 3: Regression (cont) & GLM *BRENDAN*

APA graphics
  *sjPlot::plot_model()
    * for now, don't worry about different types of plots
      * in fact, most arguments don't work right for univariate regression
    * show.data = T
  * ggpubr::ggscatter()
    * add stat_cor() so they can add the text of the correlation to it

* confint()
* predict() -- within and out-of sample

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lab 4: Two continuous predictors *CORY*
-partial correlations
-semi-partial correlations (don't talk about how they're not symmetric -- this will be a HW question)
-partial & semi-partial MATRIX
-functions to teach = ppcor::pcor.test() and ppcor::spcor.test()
-extracting output from these functions
-multiple regression with two continuous predictors (how to interpret coefficients)
-show how to make tables
  sjPlot -- can put two regression models in a single table

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lab 5: Categorical predictors/one-way ANOVA *BRENDAN*
-stats::aov() 
-making your categorical predictor a factor (make sure it's not numeric--thinks it's continuous and will do it wrong--show them the wrong way)
  --if it's continuous, the degrees of freedom will be 1 (which is wrong!); if it's a factor (as it should be), it will be the number of groups minus 1
  --this doesn't matter in the two groups case, bc in this case df will also equal 1
-review how factors work in R (don't talk about ordered vs. non-ordered)
-look at degrees of freedom for your categorical predictor--does it make sense? 
- dummy coding and effects coding
* setting dummy codes with constrasts(outcome) = contr.treatment(1) #replace 1 with whatever level you want to be the reference
* also setting effects coding with contr.sum(3) #3 being the reference group
  --intercept = grand mean and slope = difference between each group and grand mean 
  
* aov() will get you sums of squares, and then you can do pairwise.t.test and use Bonferonni and Holm corretion
* if you do ANOVA using lm(), you get traditional ANOVA table in additiona to built-in pairwise comparions 

* plotting and making tables (sjPlot and stargazer)--you've already learned these functions, now we're just putting in a different type of model

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lab 6: Assumptions and Diagnostics *CORY*

Don't worry about going through all the code covered in lecture. 
Primary goals should be 
- sjPlot::plot_model(., type = "diag") #plots 4 diagnostic plots
- plotting residuals against 
    * fitted values
    * predictors
    * ID (or other variables not in the model, like date or gender)

You might also point them back to the olsrr package, which has good documentation and useful plots for detecting outliers: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/olsrr/vignettes/influence_measures.html -- 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lab 7: Interactions *BRENDAN*

-interaction with continuous predictors 
-simple slopes ("by hand" with +/- 1 SD)
-reghelper::simple_slopes()
-plotting interactions with sjPlot (plot_model, type = "int"")--look at lecture slides for other options for plotting (switching between X and Y, plotting moderator at specific values)
-for inspiration, see: 
-http://www.strengejacke.de/sjPlot/
-http://www.strengejacke.de/sjPlot/articles/plot_interactions.html

-centering and standardizing

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lab 8: Factorial ANOVA *BRENDAN*

-use lm() function (it'll give you the same thing as aov())
  -anova() on lm object gives you anova table
-create tables:
  -apa.aov.table() - factorial ANOVA output
  -apa.2way.table() --> gives you just means and marginal means
  -https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/apaTables/vignettes/apaTables.html

- emmeans package for obtaining means and SEs for groups (look at slides for Thursday 2/27)
 > fit = lm(Y ~ X1*X2, data = data)
 > all.means = ref.grid(fit)
 > x1.means = ref.grid(fit, "x1")
 
-sjPlot:: plot_model() to get plots of marginal means and conditional means --> this gives you dots

-if you want barplots instead...
-ggpubr will give you a bar plot instead of dots (which plot_model gives you)
  -NOTE: the confidence intervals will look different for each group because it does not pool standard deviations (which isn't accurate if you've met the homogeniety of variance assumption)
  -don't go over ggpubr in lab, just link to ggpubr page or point them to Sara's source code from lecture
  -you can also show them code for using sjplot::plot_model() output (means and CIs) to create a ggplot bar graph (see Sara's code from Slack)

-calculating eta squared
-lsr::etaSquared

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lab 9: Papaja *CORY*

-creating tables
https://crsh.github.io/papaja_man/reporting.html#tables (also link to this whole book)

-create a model
-apa_print() will allow you to index separate coefficients that you can put in in-line code
-apa_table(apa_print(model_object)$table) will genereate latex code to give you a formatted model summary table

Lab 10: Bootstrapping *CORY*

-use when you can't assume estimate is normally distribution; e.g. correlations 
-use when comparing very small or unequal samples 
-use when you want to get precision around some estimate that doens't come with it's own standard error (e.g. R^2, Cronbach's alpha)

- boot::boot() function
- base R cheatsheet for functions
- other options to mention:
  - papaja::apa_print.list()
  - lavaan
