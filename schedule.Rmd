# Weekly schedule

LSR readings can be found in the free, online textbook, [_Learning Statistics with R_](https://learningstatisticswithr-bookdown.netlify.com/index.html) by Danielle Navarro. For those interested in taking notes, I recommend the use of the [Hypothes.is](http://Hypothes.is) app to annotate webpages. I will note that the formatting of the book online is wonky in a few places. If this bothers you, or you prefer to work offline, you can download a [PDF version](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/lsr-0.6.pdf) of the book. We will also use An Introduction to Statistical Learning (**ISLR**) for supplemental readings. You can find a free version of [ISLR here](https://www.statlearning.com/). You can use either the first or second version. All other readings will be provided on this page, in the lecture slides, and on our GitHub page.

**PR = Peer Review**

# Overview

This course is the second in a two-course sequence that introduces necessary skills and knowledge for carrying out statistical analyses in the social sciences. The course has an applied focus for psychological research, but theoretical details will be emphasized when they facilitate understanding of key concepts. In other words, we will strike a balance between learning how to do statistics and knowing why we are doing it a particular way. Mastering both will facilitate generalization to new problems and techniques. We will primarily be covering regression analyses throughout this semester, including extensions of classic regression analyses.

# Graded materials

Your final grade is comprised of three components:

  - 3 Exams: 20\% each, 60\% total
  - 5 Homework: 6\% each, 30\% total
  - 5 Peer Reviews: 2\% each, 10\% total

## Exams

There will be 2 exams and 1 final, each worth 20% of your grade. They will test both your theoretical understanding of concepts, as well as your applied understanding of the material. You will not be expected to open `R` and code during these exams, however you will be expected to understand `R` code that has been provided. 

Exams 1 & 2 will work the same way as they did last semester. They will open on Tuesday at 9am and will be due the following Wednesday at 11:59pm.

The final is very similar to last semester, where it is technically a cumulative exam, but emphasis is on the last third of the class and broad topics/analytics from the first two thirds of the class. 

## Homework assignments

Homework assignments are intended to gauge your ability to apply the topics covered in class to the practice of data analysis. Homework assignments are to be done using `R` and RMarkdown; completed assignments should be submitted to Canvas. Please submit BOTH your **.Rmd** and **.html** file. Please do *not* use PDF or Word documents. There will be 5 assignments in total, each worth 6% of your grade.

HWs are due at their due date by 9:30am. Grading will go by the following rubric:

- 6/6: Completed all parts of the assignment, and results/interpretations were mostly correct (with maybe a few minor errors along the way)
- 5/6: Completed all parts of the assignment, and ~25% of the results/interpretations are incorrect
- 4/6: Completed all parts of the assignment, however ~50% of the results/interpretations are incorrect
- 4/6: Either parts of the assignment are missing but what is there is correct, OR all parts have been completed but there are substantial issues with the results/interpretation
- 2/6: Parts of the assignment are missing, and there are substantial issues with the results/interpretation
- 1/6: Nearly all of the assignment is missing, but something was turned in
- 0/6: No assignment submitted

All of this to say that you can still get a 6 out of 6 even if you get a few things wrong here and there. HW assignments should boost your grades, not hurt them.

You may work with your peers on homework assignments, with the following caveats:

1. Your code cannot be 100% identical to your peer's code (trust me, we can tell). It’s one thing to work together and consult, but it’s another thing to copy someone else’s assignment. If it is determined that someone copied an entire homework assignment, both parties will be given automatic zero.
2. If you work with someone, you *must* acknowledge them in the assignment itself.

## Peer Reviews

It’s important to get feedback on your work not just from the instructors/AIs but also from your peers. You will gain valuable experience in reading other peoples’ code, which is far more prevalent than you might expect. Code reviews will take place on Canvas in Discussion threads. You will submit your code to the discussion thread by the assignment due date. You then have 72 hours (3 days) to complete the code review. You will follow the the template I provide for each code review. Each review will be worth 2% each for a total of 10% of your grade. These are intended to boost your grade. Please note that late peer reviews will be docked unless given the OK by the instructor. .5 points if you submit on the due date but after the morning time. Docked 1 point if 1 day late. And a 0 if more than 1 day late. 


## Final Grading Rubric

All assignments and examinations are mandatory. If you need to miss an exam you must get in touch with me as soon as possible. Rescheduling of exams will be considered on a case by case basis, but I am _not_ required to approve a rescheduled exam.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}

& \text{> 100% = A+} \\
& \text{93% - 99.99% = A} \\
& \text{90% - 92.99% = A-} \\
& \text{87% - 89.99% = B+} \\
& \text{83% - 86.99% = B} \\
& \text{80% - 82.99% = B-} \\

\end{split}

\begin{split}
& \text{77% - 79.99% = C+} \\
& \text{73% - 76.99% = C} \\
& \text{70% - 72.99% = C-} \\
& \text{67% - 69.99% = D+} \\
& \text{63% - 66.99% = D} \\
& \text{60% - 62.99% = D-} \\
&\text{< 50% = F}

\end{split}
\end{equation}

# Class Policies

## University Code of Conduct

- Any student found guilty of academic misconduct, such as cheating, plagiarizing, forgery, or furnishing false information to a University official will be subject to consequences including failing the class, suspension from the University, or expulsion from the University. Frankly, you're in graduate school, and the purpose of work is to create opportunities to learn and improve. Even if cheating helps you in the short term, you'll quickly find yourself ill-prepared for the career you have chosen. If you find yourself tempted to cheat, please come speak to me about an extension and developing tools to improve your success.
- Please see the official [University Code of Conduct](https://wustl.edu/about/compliance-policies/academic-policies/university-student-judicial-code/)

## Special Accommodations

- This includes but is not limited to a learning, sensory, or physical disability or any other diagnosis that requires special accommodations and/or assistance with lectures, reading, written assignments, and/or exam taking
- Contact [Disability Resources](https://students.wustl.edu/disability-resources/) at [disabilityresources@wustl.edu](mailto:disabilityresources@wustl.edu) or call 314-935-5970
- Please also contact me as soon as possible if you need special accommodations. Once I have the Accommodation Letter from [Disability Resources](https://students.wustl.edu/disability-resources/), we can discuss ways to modify the course experience for you.

## Attendance (NEW)

- I expect all students to be in class if they are able (not sick, not at a conference etc.). Students find that the content from this semester is far more challenging than the previous semester. The best way to succeed is to come to class.
- I will take attendance this semester. **If you are absent for 2 class periods in a row, _and you have not reached out to either the instructor or the AIs_, I will assume that something is wrong.** When I have concerns about a graduate student, I contact their PI. I will do the same here. 
  * If you reach out and say you need to miss class for whatever reason, then there is no need for me to contact your PI. I know you are alive and well (or at least getting well). 
  * This policy comes out of concern for you! It's hard to succeed if you aren't in class, and I really want you to succeed! 
  * You are adults. Come to class when you can. Let me know when you can't (quick email or Slack is OK). 
- **If you are not feeling well, don't come to class!!** I have recorded lectures from last year, you have access to the slides, and you can ask a friend for notes.
- If there is even a *hint* of being sick, I prefer you stay home. If you are 100% sure it's nothing contagious -- like allergies, I still ask that you wear a mask and sit away from other students. 
- WUSTL makes you fill out a COVID screening form before coming to campus. If you are in quarantine because of COVID exposure, or you fail the screening form because you are showing symptoms, please forward the screening form to me! Having a paper trail is extremely helpful for everyone. 

# Learning from a Crappy Year 

The 2020-2021 academic year sucked. But instead of burying our heads in the sand and forgetting it existed, let's at least extract some things and incorporate them into our lives. For this class, here's what that means...

### Staying Connected

Last year was lonely. Although we're back in person, we still might feel that residual loneliness. On top of that, learning stats, learning to code, and grad school in general can be really scary -- impostor syndrome is real! The best thing we can do to combat these feelings is to stay connected to one another. Here's how we'll accomplish this in our class:

-	Your peer review will be with the same person (different from last semester, if possible, though). This way, you will get to know your buddy over the course of the semester. Make a friend! 

-	We will have a dedicated class Slack work space (see upper right corner of website for link). You can post questions that everyone can see, or make use of direct messaging. Shelly or the AIs will respond to your questions on Slack (if your peers don't respond first!). This is really great for one-off questions, or if you need some quick clarification on something. We will also have a dedicated channel for silly programming and stats memes, because humor is important when you're learning a skill like coding, in which you’ll repeatedly fail. Slack is not required *per se*, but it is **highly encouraged**.

### Be Considerate and Kind

- It is OK to not be OK. If you tell me you're having trouble, I'm not going to judge you or think less of you. I hope you will do the same for me. I will work with you to make sure we have a reasonable plan in place should something come up. *However*, this does require you telling me "hey, I'm not OK".
- You are always welcome to come talk to me about things that you're going through. If I can't help you, I usually know someone who can help -- or I can at least give you some resources and point you in the right direction.
- If you are struggling or need extra help, please just ask. I promise I will work with you.

### In-person Etiquette

- Most people will have electronics with them in class. Drinks should have a lid on them so that if they spill, we hopefully aren't ruining yours or another person's laptop/tablet/phone etc. Be careful!
- Occasionally, I'll ask you to get into small groups and chat about something. Be aware that other people might not be super comfortable being physically close together. Maintain appropriate distance, and if a classmate asks you to step back a bit, please do so. 
- And again, if you are not feeling 100%, please do not come to class!

### Online Etiquette

There will be a lot of online communication with the instructor, the AI, and your peers. You are expected to maintain a polite and respectful tone in their online discourse. Some things to consider:

  -	Any communication shared privately may become public, so be mindful of what you share in discussion boards or chats. This is especially true for sharing any personal and/or identifying information about you or someone else. Do not share any passwords or divulge any personal information (yours or others) that can be used in a malicious manner (phone numbers, addresses etc.).
  -	Humor doesn't always translate in an online forum. If you want to make a joke or a sarcastic remark, be 100% sure that it is clear you are joking. 
  -	Your comments must be readable to everyone. Very common acronyms are OK (“lol” or “haha”). But please refrain from acronyms that are not as well-known (“fwiw” etc.).
  -	Treat your classmates, professor, and AIs with kindness and respect. Any indication of online harassment or bullying will not be tolerated and will be reported. This is especially pertinent when giving constructive feedback in code reviews.
  - Please avoid using ALL CAPS because it can be interpreted as yelling.
