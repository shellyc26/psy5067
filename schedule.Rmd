# Weekly schedule

LSR readings can be found in the free, online textbook, [_Learning Statistics with R_](https://learningstatisticswithr-bookdown.netlify.com/index.html) by Danielle Navarro. For those interested in taking notes, I recommend the use of the [Hypothes.is](http://Hypothes.is) app to annotate webpages. I will note that the formatting of the book online is wonky in a few places. If this bothers you, or you prefer to work offline, you can download a [PDF version](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/lsr-0.6.pdf) of the book.

# Graded materials

Your final grade is comprised of three components:

  - 6 Homework: 5\% each, 30% total
  - 3 Exams: 20\% each, 60\% total 
  - 4 Check-ins: 2\% each (+ 2\% from day 1), 10\% total 

## Exams

There will be 2 exams and 1 final, each worth 20% of your grade. They will test both your theoretical understanding of concepts, as well as your applied understanding of the material. You will not be expected to open R and code during these exams, however you will be expected to understand R code that has been provided. 

Exams 1 & 2 will work the same way as they did last semester. They will open on Tuesday at 10am and will be due the following Thursday at 10am (that is, you have 48hrs to complete it).

The final exam will be cumulative, with an emphasis on the last third of the course. It will operate the same way the 3rd exam did last semester. You will have 10-14 day window to complete it, but as soon as you open the file, you have 50hrs to finish.

## Homework assignments

Homework assignments are intended to gauge your ability to apply the topics covered in class to the practice of data analysis. Homework assignments are to be done using R and RMarkdown; completed assignments should be submitted to Canvas. Please submit BOTH your **.Rmd** and **.html** file. Please do *not* use PDF or Word documents. There will be 6 assignments in total, each worth 5% of your grade.

HWs are due at their due date by 10am. *There will be no opportunity for resubmissions this semester*. Grading will go by the following rubric:

- 5/5: Completed all parts of the assignment, and results/interpreations were mostly correct (with maybe a few minor errors along the way)
- 4/5: Completed all parts of the assignment, and ~25% of the results/interpretations are incorrect
- 3/5: Completed all parts of the assignment, however ~50% of the results/intepretations are incorrect
- 2/5: Either parts of the assignment are missing but what is there is correct, OR all parts have been completed but there are substantial issues with the results/interpretation
- 1/5: Parts of the assignment are missing, and there are substantial issues with the results/interpreation
- 0/5: No assignment submitted

All of this to say that you can still get a 5 out of 5 even if you get a few things wrong here and there. HW assignments should boost your grades, not hurt them.

You may work with your peers on homework assignments, with the following caveats:

1. Your code cannot be 100% identical to your peer's code (trust me, I can tell). It’s one thing to work together and consult, but it’s another thing to copy someone else’s assignment. If it is determined that someone copied an entire homework assignment, both parties will be given automatic zero.
2. If you work with someone, you *must* acknowledge them in the assignment itself.

## Check-ins

There will be 10 Zoom check-ins held most Thursdays of the semester from 10am-11:30am central time. **You must attend 4 out of these 10 in order to get your 5% of participation points.** It does not matter which ones you attend -- just that you attend. This is a great opportunity to come prepared with questions or ask about concepts that are confusing or about any issues with your R code. We are here to help! Attendance at each of these will be worth 2%. Attendance on the 1st day of classes is also worth 2%, so your total attendance/participation grade adds to 10% of your final grade.

Additionally, we have created a Slack channel for this class. You can use this forum to ask questions and talk to your classmates, as well as interact with us. We will respond to questions (assuming one of your classmates doesn't reply first!) about the content. This channel is NOT to be used to discuss your homework assignments or exams, however. Those tasks must be accomplished on your own. 

# Materials needed

We will be using R for all data wrangling, visulaization, and analysis. You may not use another statistical program in this course. The beginning of the semester is a great time to make sure your R and RStudio are up to date! 

All reading assignments will be posted online. 

# Policies & Resources

- Any student found guilty of academic misconduct, such as cheating, plagiarizing, forgery, or furnishing false information to a University official will be subject to consequences including failing the class, suspension from the University, or expulsion from the University. Frankly, you're in graduate school, and the purpose of work is to create opportunities to learn and improve. Even if cheating helps you in the short term, you'll quickly find yourself ill-prepared for the career you have chosen. If you find yourself tempted to cheat, please come speak to me about an extension and developing tools to improve your success.

# COVID-19 & How to be OK

*(This section was created and slightly modified from [this awesome tweet by Dr. Chris Jones](https://twitter.com/ProfChrisMJones/status/1282036533562834944). And, you know, the state of the world)*

In case you hadn’t noticed, there is a **_global pandemic_**. None of us are really “OK”. If you tell me you’re having trouble, I’m not going to judge you or think less of you. I hope you’ll extend me the same grace. 

Let’s set the stage:

  -	You never owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical), or anything else. Since this course is entirely online, we do not have to worry about the whole class physically distancing or needing to go into quarantine if one of us is exposed.
  -	You are always welcome to come talk to me about things that you’re going through, however.
  -	If I can’t help you, I usually know somebody who can.
  -	If you need extra help or you need more time with something, just ask. I’ll work with you. Promise. 

# Online Learning

For those of you who have never taken an online class (and those who have!), one thing you might not be prepared for is the amount of *intrinsic motivation* needed to succeed. While it’s great to be able to access material at your own pace, many students mistakenly think this somehow makes the class easier. It is, unfortunately, all too common for students to fall into the trap of procrastination and ultimately fall behind in the class. Don’t let this be you! Here are some steps you can take right now to ensure you are ready to rock and roll:

  - Make a schedule for yourself, and stick to it! Carve out time to watch the lectures and complete the homeworks & quizzes. Time management is the key to online success and graduate school more generally. There are TONS of apps and tools to help you with this and can take the form of calendars, organizers, time tracking apps etc.
  - If you get distracted by all the other websites on the planet, consider some apps like [Cold Turkey](https://getcoldturkey.com/), [Freedom](https://freedom.to/stayfocusd), or others that will block external sites (Twitter, Netflix etc.) and help you focus.
