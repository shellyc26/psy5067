## Textbook

We will primarily be referring to chapters in [_Learning Statistics with R_](https://learningstatisticswithr-bookdown.netlify.com/index.html) by Danielle Navarro. This textbook is available for free online. You may choose to purchase a paper copy if you wish, but it is not required. Additional readings assignments will be posted here. 


## Resources for R and RStudio

While we will be covering the use of R and RStudio extensively in both lecture and lab, one of the key skills required to use R is the ability to find answers on the Internet. The R commmunity (sometimes referred to as the useR community) tends to be friendly and helpful and enjoys solving R-related problems in their spare time. For that reason, many common questions or problems have been posted to spaces online and answered by smart people. Finding and deciphering those answers is the key skill you should seek to hone this year. It's much more important than remembering function names. 

Here are some sites where you can find the answers to many R questions and learn new tricks:
