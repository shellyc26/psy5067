Homework assignments will appear here. You'll be able to access the assignment, as well as any data that may be used. Homework assignments will be posted **at least one week** before they are due. Submit homework assignments via Canvas by the due date and time.

Note that this semester you will be making your RMarkdown/RNotebook (anything with the extension `.Rmd`) files on your own. If you need help, within RStudio, go to Help > Cheatsheets and select either the R Markdown Cheat Sheet or the R Markdown Reference Guide for help with formatting. Please contact us ASAP with any questions or issues when knitting to HTML.
