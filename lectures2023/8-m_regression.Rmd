- Semi-partial and partial correlations

## Today

- Introduction to multiple regression

---

## Regression equation

$$\large \hat{Y} = b_0 + b_1X_1 + b_2X_2 + \dots+b_kX_k$$

- regression coefficients are "partial" regression coefficients  

  - predicted change in $Y$ for a 1 unit change in $X$, *holding all other predictors constant* 
  
  - similar to semi-partial correlation -- represents part of each $X$

---
## Interpretting multiple regression model
$$\large \hat{Y} = b_0 + b_1X_1 + b_2X_2 + \dots+b_kX_k$$

- Intercept is the value of $Y$ when all predictors = 0
- Regression coefficients are the predicted change in $Y$ for a 1 unit change in $X$, *holding all other predictors constant*

--

- Residual in simple regression can be thought of as a measure of $Y$ that is left over after accounting for your DV
- Partial correlation can be created by:

  1. create a measure of $X_1$ that is independent of $X_2$
  2. create a measure of $Y$ that is independent of $X_2$
  3. correlate the new measures

## Example
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(here)
stress.data = read.csv(here("data/stress.csv"))
library(psych)
describe(stress.data$Stress)
```

---

## Example

```{r, output.lines = c(9:19)}
mr.model <- lm(Stress ~ Support + Anxiety, data = stress.data)
summary(mr.model)
```

???

If a univariate regression is estimating the best-fit line, what is this estimating?

---
## Visualizing multiple regression

```{r}
library(visreg)

visreg2d(mr.model,"Support", "Anxiety", plot.type = "persp")

```

---

## Calculating coefficients 

Just like with univariate regression, we calculate the OLS solution. As a reminder, this calculation will yield the estimate that reduces the sum of the squared deviations from the line:

.pull-left[
### Unstandardized
$$\large \hat{Y} = b_0 + b_{1}X1 + b_{2}X_2$$
$$\large \text{minimize} \sum (Y-\hat{Y})^2 $$
]
.pull-right[

### Standardized
$$\large \hat{Z}_{Y} = b_{1}^*Z_{X1} + b_{2}^*Z_{X2}$$
$$\large \text{minimize} \sum (z_{Y}-\hat{z}_{Y})^2$$
]

---
## Calculating the standardized partial regression coefficient 

$$b_{1}^* = \frac{r_{Y1}-r_{Y2}r_{12}}{1-r_{12}^2}$$

$$b_{2}^* = \frac{r_{Y2}-r_{Y1}r_{12}}{1-r_{12}^2}$$
---
## Notice the similarity with semi-partial correlation

$$b_{1}^* = \frac{r_{Y1}-r_{Y2}r_{12}}{1-r_{12}^2}$$



$$sr = r_{y(1.2)} = \frac{r_{Y1}-r_{Y2}r_{Y12} }{\sqrt{1-r_{12}^2}}$$


---

## Relationships between partial, semi- and b*  

(Standardized) Regression coefficients, partial correlations, and semi-partial correlations are all ways to represent the relationship between two variables while taking into account a third (or more!) variables. 

  - Each is a standardized effect, meaning the effect size is calculated in standardized units, bounded by -1 and 1*. This means they can be compared across studies, metrics, etc.

Note, however, that the calculations differ between the three effect sizes. These effect sizes are not synonymous and often yield different answers. 

  - if predictors are not correlated, $r$,  sr $(r_{Y(1.2)})$ and b* are equal 

.small[*Actually, standardized regression coefficients are not bounded by -1 and 1, but it's rare to see values this large, and usually they're a sign that you have some problems in the model. ]

** Standardized multiple regression coefficient** $b^*$

$$\large \frac{r_{Y1}-r_{Y2}r_{12}}{1-r_{12}^2}$$


** Semi-partial correlation** $r_{y(1.2)}$
$$\large \frac{r_{Y1}-r_{Y2}r_{Y12} }{\sqrt{1-r_{12}^2}}$$

** Partial correlation** $r_{y1.2}$
$$\large \frac{r_{Y1}-r_{Y2}r_{{12}}}{\sqrt{1-r^2_{Y2}}\sqrt{1-r^2_{12}}}$$

  s = sd(x, na.rm=T)
  z = (x-m)/s
  return(z)
}

stress.data = stress.data %>%
  mutate(z_anxiety = z_score(Anxiety),
         z_support = z_score(Support),
         z_stress = z_score(Stress))

mod0 = lm(z_stress ~ z_anxiety + z_support, 
          data = stress.data)

round(coef(mod0),3)
```

.pull-left[
```{r, message=F, warning = F, echo = 2:4}
library(ppcor)
spcor.test(x = stress.data$Anxiety, 
           y = stress.data$Stress, 
           z = stress.data$Support)$estimate
```

pcor.test(x = stress.data$Anxiety, 
          y = stress.data$Stress,

point is they're not the same, but they're close!

## Review

.pull-left[

#### Original Metric

$$b_{1} = b_{1}^*\frac{s_{Y}}{s_{X1}}$$

$$b_{1}^* = b_{1}\frac{s_{X1}}{s_{Y}}$$
]

.pull-right[

#### Intercept

$$b_{0} = \bar{Y} - b_{1}\bar{X_{1}} - b_{2}\bar{X_{2}}$$

## Multiple correlation, R

$$\large \hat{Y} = b_{0} + b_{1}X_{1} + b_{2}X_{2}$$


- $\hat{Y}$ is a linear combination of Xs
- $r_{Y\hat{Y}}$ = multiple correlation = R

--

$$\large R = \sqrt{b_{1}^*r_{Y1} + b_{2}^*r_{Y2}}$$
$$\large R^2 = {b_{1}^*r_{Y1} + b_{2}^*r_{Y2}}$$

## Decomposing sums of squares

We haven't changed our method of decomposing variance from the univariate model

$$\Large \frac{SS_{regression}}{SS_{Y}} = R^2$$
$$\Large {SS_{regression}} = R^2({SS_{Y})}$$



$$\Large {SS_{residual}} = (1- R^2){SS_{Y}}$$
  
---

## significance tests

- $R^2$ (omnibus)  
- Regression Coefficients  
- Increments to $R^2$  
    
---

## R-squared, $R^2$


- Same interpretation as before  

- Adding predictors into your model will increase $R^2$ â€“ regardless of whether or not the predictor is significantly correlated with Y.    

- Adjusted/Shrunken $R^2$ takes into account the number of predictors in your model  


---

## Adjusted R-squared, $\text{Adj} R^2$

$$\large R_{A}^2 = 1 - \frac{Var_{res}}{Var_{total}}$$


$$\large R_{A}^2 = 1 - \frac{\frac{SS_{res}}{n-p-1}}{\frac{SS_{total}}{n-1}}$$
$$\large R_{A}^2 = 1 - (1 -R^2)\frac{n-1}{n-p-1}$$
---

## Adjusted R-squared, $\text{Adj} R^2$

$$\large R_{A}^2 = 1 - (1 -R^2)\frac{n-1}{n-p-1}$$
- What happens if you add many IV's to your model that are uncorrelated with your DV?

--


- What happens as you add more covariates to your model that are highly correlated with your key predictor, X?

$$b_{1}^* = \frac{r_{Y1}-r_{Y2}r_{12}}{1-r_{12}^2}$$

## Test of individual regression coefficients

$$\Large H_{0}: \beta_{X}= 0$$
$$\Large H_{1}: \beta_{X} \neq 0$$

---

## Test of individual regression coefficients

In the case of univariate regression:

$$\Large se_{b} = \frac{s_{Y}}{s_{X}}{\sqrt{\frac {1-r_{xy}^2}{n-2}}}$$

In the case of multiple regression:

$$\Large se_{b} = \frac{s_{Y}}{s_{X}}{\sqrt{\frac {1-R_{Y\hat{Y}}^2}{n-p-1}}} \sqrt{\frac {1}{1-R_{i.jkl...p}^2}}$$

- As N increases... 
- As variance explained increases...
