## Regression

Regression is a general data analytic system, meaning lots of things fall under the umbrella of regression. This system can handle a variety of forms of relations, although all forms have to be specified in a linear way. Usefully, we can incorporate IVs of all nature -- continuous, categorical, nominal, ordinal....

The output of regression includes both effect sizes and, if using frequentist or Bayesian software, statistical significance. We can also incorporate multiple influences (IVs) and account for their intercorrelations.

### Regression

- **Scientific** use: explaining the influence of one or more variables on some outcome. 

  + Does this intervention affect reaction time?
  + Does self-esteem predict relationship quality?
  
- **Prediction** use: We can develop models based on what's happened in the past to predict what will happen in the figure.

  + Insurance premiums
  + Graduate school... success?
  
- **Adjustment**: Statistically control for known effects

  + If everyone had the same level of SES, would abuse still be associated with criminal behavior?

## Regression equation

What is a regression equation?

- Functional relationship

  - Ideally like a physical law $(E = MC^2)$
  
  - In practice, it's never as robust as that
  
How do we uncover the relationship?

---

### How does Y vary with X?

- The regression of Y (DV) on X (IV) corresponds to the line that gives the mean value of Y corresponding to each possible value of X

- $\large E(Y|X)$

- "Our best guess" regardless of whether our model includes categories or continuous predictor variables

- We will evaluate our guesses based on how far away we are from the mean. But how do we come up with those guesses in the first place?

---

## Regression Equation

$$\Large Y = b_{0} + b_{1}X +e$$

$$\Large \hat{Y} = b_{0} + b_{1}X$$

$\hat{Y}$ signifies the predicted score -- no error

The difference between the predicted and observed score is the residual ( $e_i$ )

There is a different $e$ value for each observation in the dataset

---

## OLS
- How do we find the regression estimates? 
- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimation
- Minimizes deviations 

$$ min\sum(Y_{i}-\hat{Y})^{2} $$ 

- Other estimation procedures possible (and necessary in some cases)

## What is error?

$$\Large Y = b_{0} + b_{1}X +e$$

$$\Large \hat{Y} = b_{0} + b_{1}X$$

$$\Large Y_i = \hat{Y_i} + e_i$$

$$\Large e_i = Y_i - \hat{Y_i}$$

---

## OLS

The line that yields the smallest sum of squared deviations

$$\Large \Sigma(Y_i - \hat{Y_i})^2$$
$$\Large = \Sigma(Y_i - (b_0+b_{1}X_i))^2$$
$$\Large = \Sigma(e_i)^2$$

--

In order to find the OLS solution, you could try many different coefficients $(b_0 \text{ and } b_{1})$ until you find the one with the smallest sum squared deviation. Luckily, there are simple calculations that will yield the OLS solution every time.

---
## Regression coefficient, $b_{1}$

$$\large b_{1} = \frac{cov_{XY}}{s_{x}^{2}} = r_{xy} \frac{s_{y}}{s_{x}}$$

$$\large r_{xy} = \frac{s_{xy}}{s_xs_y}$$

- The regression coefficient (slope) equals the estimated change in Y for a 1-unit change in X  
- For nominal variables using dummy coding (0s and 1s), the regression coefficient equals the difference in means between the 2 groups (remember, correlation can be used for nominal variables!)

.tiny[Suggested Practice: Go in `R` and see if you can prove to yourself that these equations are the same!]

---
## Standardized regression

- Regression using z-scores for Y and X
- Correlation equals standardized regression coefficient

$$\large b_{1} = r_{xy} \frac{s_{y}}{s_{x}}$$

$$ \large r_{xy} = b_1\frac{s_x}{s_y} $$

If the variance of both X and Y is equal to 1 (as in z-scores): 

$$\large \beta_{1} = b_{1}^* = r_{xy}$$

---

## Standardized regression equation

$$\large Y = b_{1}^*X+e$$

$$\large b_{1}^* = b_{1}\frac{s_x}{s_y}$$
--

According to this regression equation, when $X = 0, Y = 0$. Our interpretation of the coefficient is that a one-standard deviation increase in X is associated with a $b_{1}^*$ standard deviation increase in Y. Our regression coefficient is equivalent to the correlation coefficient *when we have only one predictor in our model.*

---

## Estimating the intercept, $b_0$
(AKA how to get the raw score regressione equation)

- Re-write equation to include the means of Y and X ( $\bar{X}$ & $\bar{Y}$ )
- Intercept serves to adjust for differences in means between X and Y

$$\Large \hat{Y} = \bar{Y} + r_{xy} \frac{s_{y}}{s_{x}}(X-\bar{X})$$
- If standardized, intercept drops out
- Otherwise, intercept is where regression line crosses the y-axis at X = 0  
- Notice that when  $X = \bar{X}$ the regression line goes through  $\bar{Y}$. This is true for all regressions such that the regression line must pass through $\bar{X}$  and  $\bar{Y}$

---

## Example



```{r}
galton.data <- psychTools::galton
head(galton.data)
describe(galton.data, fast = T)
cor(galton.data)
```

---

If we regress child height onto parents':

```{r}
r = cor(galton.data)[2,1]
m_parent = mean(galton.data$parent)
m_child = mean(galton.data$child)
s_parent = sd(galton.data$parent)
s_child = sd(galton.data$child)

(b1 = r*(s_child/s_parent))
(b0 = m_child - b1*m_parent)
```


How will this change if we regress parent height onto child height?

---

```{r}
(b1 = r*(s_child/s_parent))
(b0 = m_child - b1*m_parent)
```


```{r}
(b1 = r*(s_parent/s_child))
(b0 = m_parent - b1*m_child)
```

---
## In `R`

```{r}
fit.1 <- lm(child ~ parent, data = galton.data)
summary(fit.1)
```

---
## Reversed

```{r}
summary(lm(parent ~ child, data = galton.data))
```

???

**Things to discuss**

- Coefficient estimates
- Statistical tests (covered in more detail soon)

---


```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(galton.data, aes(x=parent, y=child)) +
    geom_point() +    
    geom_smooth(method=lm,   # Add linear regression line
                se=FALSE) +
  theme_bw(base_size = 20)
```

---

### Data, predicted, and residuals

```{r}
library(broom)
model_info = augment(fit.1)
head(model_info)
```

```{r}
describe(model_info)
```

???

Point out the average of the residuals is 0, just like average deviation from the mean is 0. 

---

## Residuals

- Dispersion of residuals can be thought of as what is left over in Y that is *not* explained by our model. As residuals get smaller on average, so will the SD of the residuals.

- Sigma ( $\sigma$ ) is the SD of residuals. It can be thought of as how much left over in Y that we cannot explain by our model.

---

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
model_info %>% ggplot(aes(x = parent, y = .fitted)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(se = F, method = "lm") + ggtitle(expression(paste("X is related to ", hat(Y))))+
  scale_x_continuous("X") + scale_y_continuous(expression(hat(Y))) + theme_bw(base_size = 30)
```

---

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
model_info %>% ggplot(aes(x = parent, y = .resid)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(se = F, method = "lm") + ggtitle("X is always unrelated to e")+
  scale_x_continuous("X") + scale_y_continuous("e") + theme_bw(base_size = 30)
```

---

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

  geom_point() + geom_smooth(se = F, method = "lm") + ggtitle(expression(paste("Y can be related to ", hat(Y))))+
  scale_x_continuous("Y") + scale_y_continuous(expression(hat(Y))) + theme_bw(base_size = 30)
```

---

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

  scale_x_continuous("Y") + scale_y_continuous("e") + theme_bw(base_size = 25)
```

---

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
model_info %>% ggplot(aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(se = F, method = "lm") + ggtitle(expression(paste(hat(Y), " is always unrelated to e")))+
  scale_y_continuous("e") + scale_x_continuous(expression(hat(Y))) + theme_bw(base_size = 30)
```

---

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
model_info %>% rename(y = child, x = parent) %>% select(x,y,.fitted,.resid) %>% gather("key", "value") %>%
  ggplot(aes(value, fill = key)) + geom_histogram(bins = 25) + guides(fill = F)+
  facet_wrap(~key, scales = "free") + theme_bw(base_size = 20)
```

---

## Residuals Summary

- Residuals are not correlated with $X$ and $\hat{Y}$ because those two are perfectly correlated with one another (that is, $r_{\text{fitted,x}} = 1$  )
- $X$ and $\hat{Y}$ represent the *same* information. We use our model ( $X$ ) to make a prediction ( $\hat{Y}$ ). These predictions are entirely based on the model.
- There is no correlation between residuals with $X$ and $\hat{Y}$ because they are created by subtracting them out of $Y$. That is, ( $\epsilon = Y - \hat{Y}$ )
- Sigma ( $\sigma$ ; the SD of residuals) can be thought of as how much left over in $Y$ after we take out all of the information our model provides.
