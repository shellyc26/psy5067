# Purpose

Today's lab will focus on correlations. We will discuss how to calculate a correlation coefficient between two variables, how to assess statistical significance of correlations, and a variety of tools for visualizing correlations, especially among large groups of variables. 

To quickly navigate to the desired section, click one of the following links:

1. [Covariance and correlation](#corcoeff)
1. [Visualizing correlations](#plot)
1. [Hypothesis testing with correlations](#stats)

You will need to load the following libraries to follow along with today's lab. If you don't have any of these packages installed, please do so now. 

```{r lab-1-1, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # for plotting and data wrangling
library(rio) # for importing data
library(psych) # for covariance and correlation functions
library(apaTables) # for correlation tables
library(pwr) # for power calculation
```

# Covariances and correlation{#corcoeff}

## Covariance

* Before we talk about correlations, let's review the concept of **covariance**. Simply put, covariance captures how the variances of two variables are related, i.e. how they *co*-vary.

$$\large cov_{xy} = {\frac{\sum{(x-\bar{x})(y-\bar{y})}}{N-1}}$$

* You'll notice that this formula looks very similar to the formula for calculating the **variance** of a single variable:

$$\large s^{2} = {\frac{\sum{(x-\bar{x})^2}}{N-1}}$$

* To calculate covariance, use `cov()`. This function comes from the `{stats}` package, which is already loaded when you open R. We'll use the `mtcars` dataset as an example:

<br>

* Calculate the covariance between `mtcars$mpg` and `mtcars$hp`:

####  {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

##### Code

```{r lab-1-2, eval=FALSE}
cov(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$hp)
```

##### Output

```{r lab-1-3, echo=FALSE, ref.label='lab-1-2'}
```

####
<br>

* Feeding `cov()` a data frame (of numeric variables), will generate a covariance matrix. Let's start with a data frame that only includes `mpg` and `hp`. We'll also round to two decimal places for convenience. 

####  {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

##### Code

```{r lab-1-4, eval=FALSE}
mtcars %>% 
  select(mpg, hp) %>% # select only our variables on interest
  cov() %>% # calculate covariance
  round(2) # round all values to 2 decimal places
```

##### Output

```{r lab-1-5, echo=FALSE, ref.label='lab-1-4'}
```

####
>**Question:** In the above output, what do the numbers along the diagonal represent? 

<br>

* We can also easily generate a covariance matrix of more than 2 variables:

####  {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

##### Code

```{r lab-1-6, eval=FALSE}
cov(mtcars) %>% 
  round(2)
```

##### Output

```{r lab-1-7, echo=FALSE, ref.label='lab-1-6'}
```

####
<br>

## Correlation      

* Correlations are *standardized* covariances. Because correlations are in standardized units, we can compare them across scales of measurements and across studies. Recall that mathematically, a correlation is the covariance divided by the product of the standard deviations. It is also equivalent to the product of two z-scored variables.

$$\large r_{xy} = {\frac{cov(X,Y)}{\hat\sigma_{x}\hat\sigma_{y}}}$$

$$\large r_{xy} = {\frac{\sum({z_{x}z_{y})}}{N}}$$
<br>

* To calculate a correlation coefficient, use `cor()` (again, from the `{stats}` package).

####  {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

##### Code

```{r lab-1-8, eval=FALSE}
cor(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$hp)
```

##### Output

```{r lab-1-9, echo=FALSE, ref.label='lab-1-8'}
```

####
<br>

* As with covariances, we can generate a matrix of correlations by feeding a data frame to `cor()`. The following code will give us a correlation matrix of `mpg` and `hp`. 

####  {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

##### Code

```{r lab-1-10, eval=FALSE}
mtcars %>% 
  select(mpg, hp) %>% 
  cor() %>% 
  round(2)
```

##### Output

```{r lab-1-11, echo=FALSE, ref.label='lab-1-10'}
```

####
<br>

* To get a correlation matrix of all the variables in our data frame:

#### {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

##### Code

```{r lab-1-12, eval=FALSE}
cor(mtcars) %>% 
  round(2)
```

##### Output

```{r lab-1-13, echo=FALSE, ref.label='lab-1-12'}
```

####
<br>

* If are given a covariance matrix, we can easily convert it to a correlation matrix using `cov2cor()`.

#### {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

##### Code

```{r lab-1-14, eval=FALSE}
# covariance matrix
cov_mat <- cov(mtcars)

# convert to correlation matrix
cov2cor(cov_mat) %>% 
  round(2)
```

##### Output

```{r lab-1-15, echo=FALSE, ref.label='lab-1-14'}
```

####

# Visualizing correlations{#plot}

* As Sara mentioned in class, it is very important to *always* visualize your data. There might be patterns in your data that are not apparent just from looking at a correlation between two variables, or even a correlation matrix for that matter. We will go over just a few basic examples here, but there are many different options for visualizing correlations. See [here](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/correlation-matrix-a-quick-start-guide-to-analyze-format-and-visualize-a-correlation-matrix-using-r-software#use-corrplot-function-draw-a-correlogram){target="_blank"} if you want to explore more options. 

## Scatter plots

* Scatter plots allow us to visualize the relationship between two variables. By now we are all familiar with scatter plots, but let's create a simple one using `ggplot()` just to jog our memory. To continue with our running example...

####  {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

##### Code

```{r lab-1-16, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp)) +
  geom_point()
```


##### Output

```{r lab-1-17, echo=FALSE, ref.label='lab-1-16'}
```

####
<br> 

* It is often useful to add a best fit line. We can do this by adding `geom_smooth(method = "lm")`. (`"lm"` stands for "linear model".) Put a pin in that for now...we'll discuss more what this line represents in a future lab.

####  {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

##### Code

```{r lab-1-18, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

##### Output

```{r lab-1-19, echo=FALSE, ref.label='lab-1-18'}
```

#### 
<br> 

## SPLOM plots

* "SPLOM" stands for scatter plot matrix. The `pairs.panel()` function from the `{psych}` package allows a quick way to visualize relationships among all the continuous variables in your data frame. The lower diagonal contains scatter plots showing bivariate relationships between pairs of variables, and the upper diagonal contains the corresponding correlation coefficients. Histograms for each variable are shown along the diagonal. 

* Note that this function is not ideal with very large data sets, as it becomes difficult to read the plots. (Also, we actually already learned this function in [PSY 611](https://uopsych.github.io/psy611/labs/lab-2.html#pairspanels()_function){target="_blank"}!

####  {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

##### Code

```{r lab-1-20, eval=FALSE}
pairs.panels(mtcars, lm = TRUE)
```

##### Output

```{r lab-1-21, echo=FALSE, ref.label='lab-1-20'}
```

####
<br>

## Heat maps

* Heat maps are a great way to get a high-level visualization of a correlation matrix. They are particularly useful for visualizing the number of "clusters" in your data if that's something you're looking for. For example the `Thurstone` dataset, built into the `{psych}` package, is a correlation matrix of items that assess different aspects of cognitive ability. We can plot a heatmap of this correlation matrix using the `corPlot()` function:

####  {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

##### Code

```{r lab-1-22, eval=FALSE}
corPlot(Thurstone)
```

##### Output

```{r lab-1-23, echo=FALSE, ref.label='lab-1-22'}
```

####
>**Question:** What do you notice about the structure of this data?

<br>

## APA Tables

* The package `{apaTables}` has a very useful function `apa.cor.table()` that creates nicely formatted tables of correlation matrices in APA format. 

####  {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

##### Code

```{r lab-1-24, eval=FALSE}
apa.cor.table(mtcars, filename = "cars.doc", table.number = 1)
```

##### Output

# Hypothesis testing with correlations{#stats}

* A correlation can be considered both a descriptive and inferential statistic. So far we've talked about how to calculate correlations between pairs of continuous variables and how to interpret them descriptively, but we haven't mentioned how to assess whether correlations are statistically meaningful. 
<br>

* To illustrate how to assess statistical significance of correlations, we are going to work with a dataset about the relationship between conscientiousness and physical health. We've collected data from 60 people (30 men and 30 women) on their self-reported conscientiousness (using the BFI) and their self-reported physical health. We want to know if there is a significant correlation between these variables, and then whether or not that correlation differs between men and women.
<br>

* Import the data using the following code and check out the structure of the data. 

```{r lab-1-25, results='hide'}
health <- import("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uopsych/psy612/master/labs/lab-1/data/consc_health.csv")

str(health)
```

## Visualize the data

####  {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

##### Code

```{r lab-1-26, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = health, aes(x = consc, y = sr_health)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

##### Output

```{r lab-1-27, echo=FALSE, ref.label='lab-1-26'}
```

#### 
<br> 

## Statistical hypotheses

$$\large H_{0}: \rho_{xy} = 0$$

$$\large H_{A}: \rho_{xy} \neq 0$$

## Power calculation 

####  {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

##### Code

```{r lab-1-28, eval=FALSE}
pwr.r.test(n = nrow(health), sig.level = .05 , power = .8)
```

##### Output

```{r lab-1-29, echo=FALSE, ref.label='lab-1-28'}
```

####

>**Question:** If our sample size were doubled (120 instead of 60), what would happen to the value of `r` in the above output? Why? What if we decreased our significance level to `.01`?

<br>

## Relevant functions

* There are a couple different functions to be aware for running statistical tests of correlations.

### `stats::cor.test()`

* By default, `cor.test()` from the `{stats}` package runs a statistical test to determine whether the observed correlation between two variables is significantly different from 0 (the null hypothesis). In addition to the usual output, it also returns a 95% CI for the correlation coefficient based on a [Fisher's r to z' transformation](https://uopsych.github.io/psy612/lectures/1-correlation.html#38){target="_blank"}. 

####  {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

##### Code

```{r lab-1-30, eval=FALSE}
cor.test(health$consc, health$sr_health)
```

##### Output

```{r lab-1-31, echo=FALSE, ref.label='lab-1-30'}
```

####
>**Question:** What can we conclude about the relationship between conscientiousness and health from this data? 

<br>

### `psych::corr.test()`

* `corr.test()` from the `{psych}` package gives the same information, but in slightly different format. 

####  {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

##### Code

```{r lab-1-32, eval=FALSE}
health %>% 
  select(consc, sr_health) %>% 
  corr.test()
```

##### Output

```{r lab-1-33, echo=FALSE, ref.label='lab-1-32'}
```

####
<br> 

* Note that in order to actually see the confidence intervals, we have to print the output of `corr.test()` and add the argument `short = FALSE`. 

####  {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

##### Code

```{r lab-1-34, eval=FALSE}
health %>% 
  select(consc, sr_health) %>% 
  corr.test() %>% 
  print(short = FALSE)
```

##### Output

```{r lab-1-35, echo=FALSE, ref.label='lab-1-34'}
```

####
<br> 

* It is often very useful to save the output of a statistical test to an object that you can then pull useful information out of. 

####  {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

##### Code

```{r lab-1-36, eval=FALSE}
# store the results of the corr.test() as a list
r_consc_health <- health %>% 
  select(consc, sr_health) %>% 
  corr.test() 

# Now we can pull out just the confidence intervals (or any other information we want!)
r_consc_health$ci
```

##### Output

```{r lab-1-37, echo=FALSE, ref.label='lab-1-36'}
```

####
<br> 

* `psych::corr.test()` is also a more flexible function because it can take in an entire data frame of continuous variables and run many statistical tests at once. Let's look again at the `mtcars` dataset, which has 11 variables.

####  {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

##### Code

```{r lab-1-38, eval=FALSE}
mtcars %>% 
  corr.test() %>% 
  print(short = FALSE)
```

##### Output

```{r lab-1-39, echo=FALSE, ref.label='lab-1-38'}
```

####
<br> 

## Comparing correlations by group

* We saw above that there is a significant positive relationship between conscientiousness and self-reported health. However, now we want to know whether or not this correlation is significantly different for men and women. 

### Visualizing by group

* First let's plot our data again, but this time split the data by gender. 

####  {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

##### Code

```{r lab-1-40, eval=FALSE}
health %>% 
  ggplot(aes(consc, sr_health, col = gender)) + 
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", alpha = 0.2) + 
  labs(x = "Conscientiousness", y = "Self-reported Health") +
  theme_minimal()
```

##### Output

```{r lab-1-41, echo=FALSE, ref.label='lab-1-40'}
```

####
>**Question:** What can we conclude from this graph?

<br>

### `psych::r.test()`

* To statistically compare the correlations between conscientiousness and self-reported health for men and women, we can use the `r.test()` function. This particular function requires the sample size, and the two correlations we're testing against each other (i.e., we can't simply pass in the dataset). So, we'll need to run the correlation separately for men and women, save those values, and then use them in the `r.test()` function.

```{r lab-1-42}
health_women <- health %>% 
  filter(gender == "female") 

health_men <- health %>% 
  filter(gender == "male")

r_women <- cor(health_women$consc, health_women$sr_health)

r_men <- cor(health_men$consc, health_men$sr_health)
```

* The argument names for `r.test()` are a little confusing. In our case, we need to supply 3 pieces of information:

1. `n` = sample size of first group 
<br>
2.`r12` = r for variable 1 and variable 2 (e.g., r for women's consc and women's health) 
<br>
3.`r34` = r for variable 3 and variable 4 (e.g., r for men's consc and men's health)

####  {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

##### Code

```{r lab-1-43, eval=FALSE}
r.test(n = 30, r12 = r_women, r34 = r_men)
```

##### Output

```{r lab-1-44, echo=FALSE, ref.label='lab-1-43'}
```

####
>**Question:** What does this test suggest about the correlation between conscientiousness and health across genders?

# Minihacks

## Minihack 1

For this minihack, calculate a 95% CI "by hand" for the correlation between conscientiousness and self-reported health from our earlier `health()` dataset. Make sure you get the same answer that was given by `cor.test()`. Hint: when calculating CI's, use the functions `fisherz()` and `fisherz2r()` from `{psych}`.

To review the steps of calculating confidence intervals using Fisher's transformation, see [here](https://uopsych.github.io/psy612/lectures/1-correlation.html#38){target="_blank"}.

```{r lab-1-45}
# Your code here
```


## Minihack 2

Now pretend that we had collected data about conscientiousness and self-reported health from 600 people instead of only 60. If we were to obtain the same point estimate of the correlation between conscientiousness and health, what would the 95% CI be of our estimate if N = 600? Explain to your neighbor how and why these confidence intervals are different.

```{r lab-1-46}
# Your code here
```

## Minihack 3

Check out [this paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0956797615586560?casa_token=UgWG-wLWieQAAAAA%3AfOBMH6ehSkk6qp7WtJrABcxdeefuzRJzHKOl6revQ7-d8cT7IfE1ejWPRbUQWmivgaWjp7OyR3LB&){target="_blank"} from Dawtry et al. (2015). Focus on Table 1 from Study 1a (see below). Your task is to replicate the correlation matrix from Table 1. For an extra bonus, format your correlation matrix using `apa.cor.table()` and open it in Microsoft Word. 

<center>
![](images/dawtry_table1.png)
</center>


You can import the data using the following code:

```{r lab-1-47}
dawtry_clean <- import("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uopsych/psy612/master/labs/lab-1/data/dawtry_2015_clean.csv")
```

The data above has been cleaned somewhat for you. For an extra data wrangling challenge, import the raw form of the data (not required):

```{r lab-1-48}
dawtry_raw <- import("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uopsych/psy612/master/labs/lab-1/data/dawtry_2015_raw.csv")
```

Note: If you use the raw data, note that you will have to create some composite variables (check out the `rowMeans()` function). Also note that items `redist2` and `redist4` must be reverse-coded before creating a composite score. 

```{r lab-1-49}
# Your code here
```
