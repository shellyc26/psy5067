## Instructions

Please complete this assignment by creating a new RMarkdown (or RNotebook) file (one that has the extension .Rmd). Be sure to include your name in the preamble. Please submit both your .Rmd and your .html files to Canvas.

#### Formatting

-   All code should be in a code chunk (gray boxes)
-   All text (as in, interpretations/opinions/summary statements etc.) should be *outside* the code chunks.
-   You may make comments in your code within the code chunks. However, no long form sentences should be in there.
-   Make use of headers! Question number should be the \#1 header (use one `#` symbol, then a space, then type "Question 1"). You may use subheaders (meaning more than 1 `#` symbol) for different parts of the question, if you wish. However, your interpreations/opinions/summary statements should not be contained within a header (that is, there should be no `#` symbols preceding it).

You are allowed to Google things. *However*, if you use code from an outside source (meaning not the lecture slides or the R help documentation), then you must provide a **working link** to the website you used. You don't need to use APA formatting or anything. Just a working url.

In the instructions, when it says ***by hand***, what we mean is that you should not use a function that is built into R to complete the task. For example, if I ask you to find the mean *by hand*, you should **not** use the `mean()` function. However, you can (and should!) use your variables. So for instance, if I ask you to find the `mean()` by hand, you may do something like `sum(variableX)/length(variableX)`. This would be an appropriate *by hand* calculation. (You don't need to type `(3 + 5 + 5 + 17) / 4`...you can still use your variables). If we do *not* specify *by hand*, then you may of course use a R function.

**Data:** You will need to use the Dawtry et al., 2015 Psychological Science article and the accompanying dataset to answer all questions. Please download this [`dawtry-hw2-data`](dawtry-hw2-data.csv) dataset for the homework, which corresponds to study 1a of the paper. [The paper can be found here](../readings/Dawtry2015-PS.pdf).

Good luck!

## Homework Questions

1.  Graph the distributions of the following items. Be sure to comment on anything you find irregular or interesting. The variables to be plotted are:

    -   Household Income
    -   Fairness and Satisfaction
    -   Social Circle Mean Income
    -   Population Mean Income
    -   Political Preference

2.  Run a regression where political preferences predict redistribution.

    -   Interpret the intercept, the regression coefficient and $R^2$
    -   Plot the regression including the raw values, a confidence band, and the regression line

3.  Create a new variable that dichotomizes political preferences into conservative and liberal variable, assuming the midpoint is conservative. Then do the following:

    -   Run a linear model with dummy coding predicting redistribution
    -   What are the conceptual differences between the regression in \#2 and \#3. Which one would you prefer?


4.  Using the `anova` function for the model output for the model computed in \#2, calculate $R^2$ "by hand" using numbers in the anova table.

5.  For the same model (\#2), interpret the residual standard error.

6.  Plot a distribution of the residuals for the model computed in \#2. Then comment on the relationship between residual standard error ($\sigma$) and the SD of this distribution.
