## Instructions

Please complete this assignment by creating a new RMarkdown (or RNotebook) file (one that has the extension .Rmd). Be sure to include your name in the preamble. Please submit both your .Rmd and your .html files to Canvas.

#### Formatting

- All code should be in a code chunk (gray boxes)
- All text (as in, interpretations/opinions/summary statements etc.) should be *outside* the code chunks. 
- You may make comments in your code within the code chunks. However, no long form sentences should be in there.
- Make use of headers! Question number should be the #1 header (use one `#` symbol, then a space, then type "Question 1"). You may use subheaders (meaning more than 1 `#` symbol) for different parts of the question, if you wish. However, your interpretations/opinions/summary statements should not be contained within a header (that is, there should be no `#` symbols preceding it).

You are allowed to Google things. *However*, if you use code from an outside source (meaning not the lecture slides or the R help documentation), then you must provide a **working link** to the website you used. You don't need to use APA formatting or anything. Just a working url. Similarly, you must do the same for any and all AI use (including Chat-GPT). You must include a working link to your conversation.

All homeworks are **independent projects**. You may not share code or answers with your peers, but you can discuss them in broad strokes. You absolutely should **not simply copy someone else’s code**. If we believe one student has copied another’s work, both students will receive a 0 on the homework assignment. If you wind up working or consulting with a peer, please list them on your assignment (the equivalent of citing their work).

In the instructions, when it says **_by hand_**, what we mean is that you should not use a function that is built into R to complete the task. For example, if I ask you to find the mean *by hand*, you should **not** use the `mean()` function. However, you can (and should!) use your variables. So for instance, if I ask you to find the `mean()` by hand, you may do something like `sum(variableX)/length(variableX)`. This would be an appropriate *by hand* calculation. (You don't need to type `(3 + 5 + 5 + 17) / 4`...you can still use your variables). If we do *not* specify *by hand*, then you may of course use a R function.

**Data:** The dataset looks at happiness in college as a relationship with school success, friendship quality, SES, and an intervention group (1 = control, 2 = study skills training, 3 = social skills training). (Note that the variable names have spaces in them, which may make it tricky to work with. I suggest renaming the variables). The data are here: [`th-project-4.csv`](th-project-4.csv)

Good luck!

## Homework Questions

1. Run a two-predictor regression predicting happiness by friendship and school success and the interaction between the two.
    - Describe your hypothesis for the interaction using the study variables
    - Describe in words what exactly the b1, b2, and b3 coefficients are telling us in this model. 

2. Compute the following 3 simple regression equations. Your choice of moderating variable depends on your hypothesis. Write out and interpret each of these simple slope equations. 
    a) The regression of Y on X at the mean of X2
    b) At one standard deviation above the mean of X2 (X2hi)
    c) At one standard deviation below the mean of X2 (X2low). 

3. Graph the three simple slopes from question 3 within a single plot.

4. Are any of these simple slopes significantly different from 0? How do you know? (i.e., I want a little more info than just "yes" or "no", but you could do this in 1-2 sentences.)
