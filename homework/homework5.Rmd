## Instructions

Please complete this assignment by creating a new RMarkdown (or RNotebook) file (one that has the extension .Rmd). Be sure to include your name in the preamble. Please submit both your .Rmd and your .html files to Canvas.

#### Formatting

-   All code should be in a code chunk (gray boxes)
-   All text (as in, interpretations/opinions/summary statements etc.) should be *outside* the code chunks.
-   You may make comments in your code within the code chunks. However, no long form sentences should be in there.
-   Make use of headers! Question number should be the \#1 header (use one `#` symbol, then a space, then type "Question 1"). You may use sub headers (meaning more than 1 `#` symbol) for different parts of the question, if you wish. However, your interpretations/opinions/summary statements should not be contained within a header (that is, there should be no `#` symbols preceding it).

You are allowed to Google things. *However*, if you use code from an outside source (meaning not the lecture slides or the R help documentation), then you must provide a **working link** to the website you used. You don't need to use APA formatting or anything. Just a working url.

All homeworks are **independent projects**. You may not share code or answers with your peers, but you can discuss them in broad strokes. You absolutely should **not simply copy someone else's code**. If we believe one student has copied another's work, both students will receive a 0 on the homework assignment.


**Data:** **Please use your own data to complete this assignment**

Good luck!

## Homework Questions

1. Write a few sentences describing your dataset and the questions you are broadly interested in.

2. Provide descriptive statistics of variables of interest (don't go crazy here -- just for the variables that you plan on using for Question 3). Are you concerned about outliers at all? How can you check? If you need to remove an outlier, do it here.

3. Run 2 different nested regressions. Provide the hypothesis being tested for each of them. (You have free reign here! This is your research and it needs to make sense. You can have continuous or categorical predictors, interactions, covariates...whatever it takes to answer the questions you're asking). Make sure your dependent variable is *continuous*. Provide a few sentences about the hypotheses you are testing here.

4. Run the model comparison. Which model should you keep and why?

5. Interpret all aspects of the output from the "winning" model. What did you learn in relation to your hypotheses?

6. Check the assumptions your winning model. Interpret what these mean and if you met each assumption.

7. Run a multiple regression to predict a *categorical* outcome. First use the `lm` function and then the `glm` function. For each model, look at both the `anova` and `summary` outputs. What are the similarities and differences between these two approaches? Which do you prefer and why?

8. Interpret your $b_0$ and $b_1$ terms for the logistic regression. Put them into odds and into probabilities. 

9. Instead of using a logit link function, rerun the analysis in #5 using a probit link function. What differences do you notice? Which one is most appropriate for your work and why?

10. We have now talked about 3 different estimation methods. OLS, MLE, and WLS. Explain what each of these does and when you might use them.

11. Pick one of your continuous variables that you feel like you know the *least* about. Please provide a bootstrapped estimate of some measure of central tendency (with bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals), as well as some bootstrapped estimate of variability (with bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals)
